secondary surgical cytoreduction in women with platinum @-@ sensitive , recurrent epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal , or fallopian @-@ tube ( " ovarian " ) cancer is widely practiced but has not been evaluated in phase 3 investigation .
we randomly assigned patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who had received one previous therapy , had an interval during which no platinum @-@ based chemotherapy was used ( platinum @-@ free interval ) of 6 months or more , and had investigator @-@ determined resectable disease ( to no macroscopic residual disease ) to undergo secondary surgical cytoreduction and then receive platinum @-@ based chemotherapy or to receive platinum @-@ based chemotherapy alone .
adjuvant chemotherapy ( paclitaxel @-@ carboplatin or gemcitabine @-@ carboplatin ) and use of bevacizumab were at the discretion of the investigator .
a total of 485 patients underwent randomization , 240 to secondary cytoreduction before chemotherapy and 245 to chemotherapy alone .
complete gross resection was achieved in 67 % of the patients assigned to surgery who underwent the procedure .
platinum @-@ based chemotherapy with bevacizumab followed by bevacizumab maintenance was administered to 84 % of the patients overall and was equally distributed between the two groups .
the hazard ratio for death ( surgery vs. no surgery ) was 1.29 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.97 to 1.72 ; P = 0.08 ) , which corresponded to a median overall survival of 50.6 months and 64.7 months , respectively .
adjustment for platinum @-@ free interval and chemotherapy choice did not alter the effect .
the hazard ratio for disease progression or death ( surgery vs. no surgery ) was 0.82 ( 95 % CI , 0.66 to 1.01 ; median progression @-@ free survival , 18.9 months and 16.2 months , respectively ) .
surgical morbidity at 30 days was 9 % ; 1 patient ( 0.4 % ) died from postoperative complications .
patient @-@ reported quality of life decreased significantly after surgery but did not differ significantly between the two groups after recovery .
in this trial involving patients with platinum @-@ sensitive , recurrent ovarian cancer , secondary surgical cytoreduction followed by chemotherapy did not result in longer overall survival than chemotherapy alone . ( Funded by the National Cancer Institute and others ; GOG @-@ 0213 ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00565851 . )
the American Cancer Society has estimated that in 2019 approximately 22,500 women would be diagnosed with epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal , or fallopian @-@ tube ( " ovarian " ) cancer , and 14,000 would die.1
despite the absence of randomized data showing a survival benefit conferred by primary cytoreductive surgery , meta @-@ analyses support the approach.2 @-@ 4
theoretically , maximal surgical effort may help overcome intrinsic drug resistance , increase drug perfusion , enhance host immunologic response , increase the growth fraction of tumor cells , and circumvent acquired drug resistance after adjuvant platinum @-@ based and taxane @-@ based systemic therapy.5 @-@ 7
unfortunately , recurrent disease develops in more than 80 % of women .
the 10 @-@ year rates of disease @-@ free survival among patients with recurrent disease are abysmal and are below 15 % .8
given the widespread adoption of primary surgical cytoreduction , it is not surprising that the approach is also strongly considered for patients with recurrent disease - particularly those who are considered to be candidates for platinum reinduction ( e.g. , a prolonged treatment @-@ free interval after platinum therapy ) and those with isolated or limited @-@ volume recurrent disease .
numerous single @-@ institution and multi @-@ institution retrospective reviews and meta @-@ analyses have bolstered support for the procedure , showing that patients who had the greatest benefit were those with little or no postoperative residual disease and those considered to be platinum @-@ sensitive.3,9 @-@ 12
current guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network list secondary cytoreduction as a treatment option for patients with a treatment @-@ free interval of 6 months or more after a complete remission from previous chemotherapy.13
a clear limitation of this body of evidence is bias in patient selection , which is not easily controlled without a randomized clinical trial .
furthermore , with the availability of bevacizumab and poly ( adenosine diphosphate @-@ ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitors as maintenance medical treatments with proven progression @-@ free survival benefit among patients with platinum @-@ sensitive , recurrent ovarian cancer who have a response to salvage therapy , it is important to clarify the role of secondary cytoreductive surgery in this disease.14 @-@ 18
therefore , we designed the Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) -0213 trial to assess whether secondary cytoreduction would increase overall survival among women with platinum @-@ sensitive , recurrent ovarian cancer who otherwise were considered to be surgical candidates .
the GOG @-@ 0213 trial is an open @-@ label , phase 3 , multicenter , international , randomized clinical trial designed to assess two clinically relevant hypotheses : that bevacizumab added to paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy followed by maintenance bevacizumab improves overall survival ( chemotherapy objective ) and that secondary surgical cytoreduction in platinum @-@ sensitive , surgically amenable patients improves overall survival ( surgical objective ) .
the trial design and patient characteristics have been reported previously , as has the successful assessment of the chemotherapy objective.14
at trial activation ( December 10 , 2007 ) , patients were eligible to participate in both the chemotherapy and surgical components of the trial if they met the criteria to be considered for secondary cytoreduction .
patients who were not eligible for the surgical component were enrolled in the chemotherapy component only .
once the required number of patients was enrolled ( 674 , on August 28 , 2011 ) , only patients meeting surgical eligibility were allowed to enroll .
at that point , 107 women had undergone randomization ( in a 1 : 1 ratio ) to surgery or no surgery .
the trial was designed by the authors and supported by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program ( CTEP ) of the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) .
the data were collected and analyzed and the manuscript was written by the authors , who vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol .
Genentech provided bevacizumab and supplemental funding support to the GOG through a cooperative research and development agreement with the NCI but played no role in the collection or analysis of data or its interpretation .
patients eligible for the surgical component of the trial had measurable ( according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors , version 1.0 ; see the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org ) , platinum @-@ sensitive , recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer that was deemed by the investigator to be amenable to complete gross resection .
all eligible patients were women 18 years of age or older who had had a complete clinical response to at least three cycles of primary platinum @-@ based chemotherapy , as assessed by a normal physical examination , a normal serum cancer antigen 125 ( CA @-@ 125 ) value , and , if obtained , negative imaging studies .
platinum sensitivity was defined as disease @-@ free survival of 6 months or more after the infusion of the last cycle of chemotherapy .
if maintenance chemotherapy ( e.g. , paclitaxel ) was administered , a minimum of 6 months since the last infusion was also required .
similarly , a treatment @-@ free window of 4 weeks or more was required if biologic therapy ( e.g. , bevacizumab ) or hormonal maintenance therapy was used .
patients were also required to have adequate renal , hepatic , and bone marrow function , as well as a GOG performance @-@ status score of 0 to 2 ( on a scale from 0 to 4 , with higher scores indicating greater disability ) .
women who were not medically fit for surgery and those with diffuse carcinomatosis , ascites , or extraabdominal disease were excluded .
patients who were assigned to the surgery group underwent their procedure within 4 weeks after registration .
the objective at surgery was resection of tumor to no gross residuum .
during the assessment of the chemotherapy objective , surgically amenable patients also underwent randomization ( in a 1 : 1 ratio ) to paclitaxel ( 175 mg per square meter of body @-@ surface area ) and carboplatin ( area under the curve [ AUC ] of 5 mg per milliliter per minute ) intravenously every 3 weeks for six cycles or to paclitaxel @-@ carboplatin ( same doses as above ) and bevacizumab ( 15 mg per kilogram of body weight ) every 3 weeks for six cycles .
CTEP approved an amendment on August 29 , 2011 , to allow the physician 's choice of either paclitaxel @-@ carboplatin or gemcitabine ( 1000 mg per square meter on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks ) plus carboplatin ( AUC of 4 mg per milliliter per minute , administered every 3 weeks ) , without or with bevacizumab for six cycles .
two additional cycles were allowed for patients having a partial response .
patients who were assigned to the bevacizumab group also received maintenance therapy with bevacizumab ( 15 mg per kilogram ) every 3 weeks until progression , death , unacceptable toxic effects , or patient voluntary withdrawal .
safety was monitored during each cycle .
the choice of chemotherapy was made at surgical randomization , and chemotherapy was administered within 6 weeks after registration or 6 weeks postoperatively .
baseline imaging with the use of abdominopelvic computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was to be completed during a 28 @-@ day window in which chemotherapy was initiated .
disease was also assessed after cycles 3 and 6 of trial treatment ( and after cycle 8 , if administered ) , every 3 months for 2 years , and then every 6 months thereafter .
surgical patients underwent radiographic assessment during a 2 @-@ week window in which chemotherapy was initiated .
physical examinations were performed and serum CA @-@ 125 levels measured at the beginning of each cycle of chemotherapy ; in maintenance , these procedures were performed every 6 weeks .
trial treatments were assigned sequentially from lists composed of randomly permuted blocks .
the list of treatments was prepared by the GOG Statistical and Data Center ( Buffalo , New York ) and remained concealed during the conduct of the trial .
during the chemotherapy component of the trial , treatment assignments were stratified according to treatment @-@ free interval ( 6 to 12 months or > 12 months after the last platinum infusion ) and participation in the surgical component of the trial ( yes or no ) .
after closure of the chemotherapy component , treatment assignments were stratified according to previous treatment @-@ free interval ( 6 to 12 months or > 12 months after the last platinum infusion ) and chemotherapy regimen ( paclitaxel @-@ carboplatin , paclitaxel @-@ carboplatin plus bevacizumab , gemcitabine @-@ carboplatin , or gemcitabine @-@ carboplatin plus bevacizumab ) .
patient @-@ reported outcomes included quality of life ( score on the Trial Outcome Index of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy @-@ Ovary ; range , 0 to 100 , with higher scores indicating a better quality of life ) , physical functioning ( score on the physical functioning subscale of the RAND 36 @-@ item Short Form Survey ; range , 0 to 100 , with higher scores indicating better physical functioning ) , and surgery @-@ related symptoms ( score on a 6 @-@ item subscale assessing surgery @-@ related side effects ; range , 0 to 24 , with higher scores indicating less severe symptoms ) .
the assessments took place at six time points : before surgery ( for those patients assigned to cytoreductive surgery ) , before initiation of chemotherapy , before cycle 3 ( 6 weeks after starting chemotherapy ) , before cycle 6 ( 15 weeks after starting chemotherapy ) , 6 months after starting chemotherapy , and 12 months after starting chemotherapy .
a 5 @-@ point difference in score between trial groups was considered to be clinically meaningful.19
the primary end point , overall survival , was measured from randomization to death from any cause on an intention @-@ to @-@ treat basis .
data on patients alive at their last follow @-@ up visit were censored at that time .
investigator @-@ assessed progression @-@ free survival , defined as the time from randomization to disease progression or death from any cause , was a secondary end point .
safety analyses , including 30 @-@ day surgical morbidity and mortality and treatment @-@ related adverse events , were reported for patients who received any assigned trial treatment .
the statistical analysis plan for the primary analysis and assessment of patient @-@ reported outcomes is available with the protocol at NEJM.org.14
during the chemotherapy component of the trial , in which two @-@ way randomization took place for the subgroup of surgical candidates , we assumed no interaction between the two randomized treatments ( chemotherapy and surgery ) .
the target enrollment for the surgical component of the trial was 485 patients and was considered mature for analysis when at least 250 deaths ( events ) were reported .
the design provided 81 % power to assess a true hazard ratio for death of 0.70 .
this would be associated with a between @-@ group difference in the percentage of patients alive at 22 months of 11.5 percentage points ( 61.5 % in the surgery group and 50 % in the no @-@ surgery group ) .
a log @-@ rank test , stratified according to the same factors that were used to balance the treatment assignments , was used to compare the treatment groups with regard to overall survival .
the relative hazard of death was estimated under the assumption of proportional hazards .
all proportional @-@ hazards models were stratified according to the factors used to balance the treatment assignments ( interval during which no platinum @-@ based chemotherapy was received [ platinum @-@ free interval ] and previous bevacizumab use ) unless otherwise noted .
the percentages of patients surviving at a particular time point were estimated with the Kaplan @-@ Meier procedure .
an interim analysis of overall survival was prespecified when at least 125 deaths ( events ) ( 50 % maturity ) were documented .
the guideline for monitoring efficacy was determined by an alpha @-@ spending function , proposed by Lan and DeMets , and harmonizes with the O 'Brien and Fleming group @-@ sequential boundary.20,21
the overall type I error was set at 0.025 ( one @-@ tailed ) , including the type I error spent for interim analyses .
similarly , the design included an O 'Brien @-@ Fleming @-@ like type II error spending function for monitoring futility .
on May 2 , 2017 , the trial data were locked for the scheduled interim analysis .
at this point , the trial was fully enrolled , and 130 events were recorded .
the interim results indicated that the boundary for futility had been crossed ; subsequently , the data and safety monitoring committee recommended that the NCI and the trial team release the trial results ahead of the scheduled maturity of the trial ( 250 events ) .
for the purpose of this presentation , the trial data were frozen and locked on April 24 , 2019 , with 197 events ( 79 % maturity ) .
from December 6 , 2007 , through June 9 , 2017 , a total of 485 patients were randomly assigned to secondary surgical cytoreduction followed by platinum @-@ based chemotherapy ( 240 patients ) or to chemotherapy alone ( 245 patients ) .
all enrolled patients ( Figure 1 ) were included in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat analyses for overall and progression @-@ free survival .
demographic and clinical characteristics of the trial sample and specific disease @-@ distribution characteristics are presented in Tables S1 and S4 .
these features were well balanced between the two groups .
previous bevacizumab exposure was recorded in 55 patients ( 11 % ) .
the median platinum @-@ free interval was 20.4 months ( interquartile range , 13.2 to 34.0 ) in the surgery group and 18.8 months ( interquartile range , 12.5 to 28.4 ) in the no @-@ surgery group .
surgical OUTCOMES
of 240 patients assigned to surgery , 225 eligible patients ( 94 % ; 15 declined surgery ) underwent secondary cytoreduction ( per @-@ protocol cohort ) and 221 had operative reports confirming the postoperative tumor residual ( 4 were excluded for pending data ) .
with the inclusion of the 15 eligible patients with measurable disease who were assigned to secondary cytoreductive surgery but did not undergo the procedure , the percentage of patients who had complete gross resection was 63 % ( 150 of 239 , excluding 1 without surgical results ) .
among women who were assigned to surgery , underwent the procedure , and had information on residual disease , the percentage who had complete gross resection was 67 % ( 150 of 224 ) .
characteristics of surgical procedures and surgical patients are presented in Table 1 and are noteworthy for a low incidence of aborted procedures ( 8 patients , 4 % ) , low 30 @-@ day morbidity ( 20 patients , 9 % ) , and low 30 @-@ day mortality ( 1 patient , 0.4 % ) .
adjuvant CHEMOTHERAPY
the median time to chemotherapy initiation in the surgery group was 40 days ( interquartile range , 28 to 51 ) , as compared with 7 days ( interquartile range , 4 to 11 ) in the no @-@ surgery group .
most patients ( 408 of 485 , 84 % ) received concomitant and maintenance bevacizumab ; the paclitaxel @-@ platinum combination was preferred ( 337 of 485 , 69 % ) .
the use of each regimen was similar within each randomized cohort .
adverse events and adverse events of special interest were consistent with previous reports related to the chosen chemotherapy and bevacizumab.14,15
no new safety signals were seen .
three deaths were considered by the investigator to be " at least possibly " related to the trial treatment ( either surgery or chemotherapy ) .
two deaths in the no @-@ surgery group were due to cardiopulmonary arrest , and one death in the surgery group was due to a pulmonary embolus ( postoperative , prechemotherapy ) .
three additional deaths were not considered to be treatment @-@ related . ( for details on chemotherapy regimens and adverse events of special interest , see Tables S2 and S3 . )
patients in the surgery group reported a significant decrease in quality of life ( Figure 2 ) and physical functioning and an increase in surgery @-@ related symptoms immediately after secondary cytoreduction .
however , there was no significant interaction between treatment group and time point and no significant difference between the groups , on average , over assessment time points , which indicates that the surgery group and the no @-@ surgery group did not differ overall in any of the patient @-@ reported outcomes .
as of April 24 , 2019 , a total of 197 deaths had occurred , and 135 patients ( 56 % ) in the surgery group were still alive , as compared with 153 ( 62 % ) in the no @-@ surgery group .
the median follow @-@ up at data lock was 48.1 months .
the adjusted hazard ratio for death ( surgery vs. no surgery ) was 1.29 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.97 to 1.72 ; P = 0.08 ) , which corresponded to a median overall survival of 50.6 months and 64.7 months , respectively ( Figure 3A ) .
the percentage of patients surviving at 3 years was 67 % ( 95 % CI , 60 to 74 ) in the surgery group and 74 % ( 95 % CI , 68 to 81 ) in the no @-@ surgery group .
the adjusted hazard ratio for disease progression or death ( surgery vs. no surgery ) was 0.82 ( 95 % CI , 0.66 to 1.01 ) , which corresponded to a median progression @-@ free survival of 18.9 months and 16.2 months , respectively ( Figure 3B ) .
the percentage surviving without progression at 3 years was 29 % ( 95 % CI , 22 to 35 ) in the surgery group and 20 % ( 95 % CI , 15 to 26 ) in the no @-@ surgery group .
an ad hoc , exploratory analysis evaluating the effect of complete gross resection on overall and progression @-@ free survival was conducted within the surgical population ( 239 patients ) , with adjustment for platinum @-@ free interval and previous bevacizumab use and number of metastatic sites .
similarly , patients from South Korea accounted for nearly half the trial population , and their aggregate incidence of complete gross resection of 65 % did not have a meaningful effect on overall survival ( hazard ratio for death excluding the South Korean cohort , 0.92 ; 95 % CI , 0.33 to 2.52 ) .
in this prospective , randomized , multinational , phase 3 clinical trial of secondary surgical cytoreduction in women with resectable , platinum @-@ sensitive , recurrent ovarian cancer , we found that the procedure followed by chemotherapy did not result in longer overall survival than chemotherapy alone .
the median progression @-@ free survival was numerically longer in the surgery group than in the no @-@ surgery group , but the hazard ratio for disease progression or death did not indicate that surgery plus chemotherapy was superior to chemotherapy alone .
although patients who underwent surgery appeared to benefit from complete gross resection , we did not find that surgery itself had an overall survival benefit over chemotherapy alone , even when restricting the analysis to patients who had complete gross resection ( 67 % of patients undergoing surgery ) .
as expected , patients who underwent cytoreductive surgery reported a significant decline in quality of life and patient @-@ reported outcomes immediately after the procedure ; by 6 weeks , they reached parity with patients who did not undergo surgery , and they maintained parity at subsequent assessments .
our findings call into question the merit of surgical cytoreduction in this population , and the shorter overall survival in the surgery group than in the no @-@ surgery group ( range in relative hazard for death , 3 % lower risk to 72 % higher risk ) among the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population underscores the importance of formally assessing the value of the procedure in clinical care .
three key items should be considered with these findings .
first , clinical trials evaluating a surgical intervention are extremely difficult to perform owing to inherent bias in patient selection and investigator interpretation of preexisting data .
the issue is compounded when no data from prospective , randomized trials that control for relevant prognostic factors are available to properly inform decision making .
evidence of patient selection for randomization was evident in the current trial , because enrollees had relatively limited tumor volume .
more than half the patients who were considered for this trial had two or fewer sites of recurrent disease ( data not shown ) , which reflects the investigator intent of achieving complete gross resection .
in addition , patients were substantially platinum @-@ sensitive , with a median platinum @-@ free interval of 20.4 months .
the effect of these two factors may have diluted an independent surgical effect .
second , previous results from this trial ( chemotherapy component ) and others have validated the clinical effect of adjuvant and maintenance bevacizumab among women treated with second @-@ line , platinum @-@ based chemotherapy ( with respect to response , progression @-@ free survival , and overall survival ) .14,15
besides the 53 patients assigned to receive no bevacizumab in the chemotherapy component , only 24 of the 432 additionally enrolled patients ( 6 % ) did not receive bevacizumab by choice at the time of randomization .
the effect of bevacizumab use on overall survival among the randomized population is presented in Figures S4A and S4B .
although a detriment in overall survival was observed among those undergoing surgery but not receiving bevacizumab , it is unknown whether patients not receiving bevacizumab at the time of either randomization were less likely to receive it in subsequent lines of therapy ; such an imbalance could affect long @-@ term outcomes .
furthermore , selection of highly active chemotherapy may have masked an incremental benefit from surgery , similar to the evaluation of bevacizumab combinations in frontline therapy.22,23
although a slight difference in the time to the first dose of chemotherapy was seen between the surgery group and the no @-@ surgery group , a landmark analysis assessing the delay in initiation of chemotherapy in the surgery group was not associated with an increase in the hazard of death ( data not shown ) .
third , the median overall survival for the entire trial cohort was nearly three times longer than expected when the trial was designed .
the precise reasons for this are unknown but are probably related to improvements in clinical care and the availability of more effective treatments , particularly those in selected populations ( e.g. , use of PARP inhibitors in patients with tumors with alterations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 ) .
extended postprogression survival can dilute the treatment effect measured according to progression @-@ free survival by reducing statistical power to assess overall survival and enabling a higher likelihood of intervening treatment.24,25
at least three other ongoing phase 3 trials are comparing surgery and chemotherapy with surgery alone : DESKTOP @-@ III ( ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT01166737 ) , Surgery for Ovarian Cancer Recurrence ( SOCceR ; Netherlands Trial Register number , NL3137 ) , and Surgery or Chemotherapy in Recurrent Ovarian Cancer ( SOC 1 ; NCT01611766 ) .
the DESKTOP @-@ III trial , now fully enrolled , has a design similar to that of the GOG @-@ 0213 trial , with overall survival as its primary end point .
the trials differ with respect to patient @-@ selection criteria and adjuvant therapy .
the DESKTOP @-@ III trial uses a selection criteria algorithm ( Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynaekologische Onkologie [ AGO ] score ) based on a performance status of 0 on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale ( range , 0 [ no disability ] to 5 [ death ] ) , ascites of less than 500 ml , and complete gross resection at primary surgery , which was shown to predict complete resection in more than 66 % of patients undergoing secondary cytoreduction.26,27
the SOC @-@ 1 trial is using the iMODEL scoring algorithm to select patients for randomization .
the use of the DESKTOP selection criteria algorithm in the DESKTOP @-@ III trial has led to complete gross resection in 68 % of the patients , a percentage similar to that in the GOG @-@ 0213 trial ( 67 % in the per @-@ protocol cohort ) .28
maturity of the DESKTOP @-@ III trial and other trials will shape the debate on the value or merit of surgery in this patient population .
in conclusion , secondary surgical cytoreduction in patients with platinum @-@ sensitive , recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer selected according to these criteria appears to be feasible , with acceptable postoperative morbidity , but did not result in longer overall survival than no surgery .
the hazard ratio for disease progression or death did not indicate that surgery plus chemotherapy was superior to chemotherapy alone .
optical sensors on wearable devices can detect irregular pulses .
the ability of a smartwatch application ( app ) to identify atrial fibrillation during typical use is unknown .
participants without atrial fibrillation ( as reported by the participants themselves ) used a smartphone ( Apple iPhone ) app to consent to monitoring .
if a smartwatch @-@ based irregular pulse notification algorithm identified possible atrial fibrillation , a telemedicine visit was initiated and an electrocardiography ( ECG ) patch was mailed to the participant , to be worn for up to 7 days .
surveys were administered 90 days after notification of the irregular pulse and at the end of the study .
the main objectives were to estimate the proportion of notified participants with atrial fibrillation shown on an ECG patch and the positive predictive value of irregular pulse intervals with a targeted confidence interval width of 0.10 .
we recruited 419,297 participants over 8 months .
over a median of 117 days of monitoring , 2161 participants ( 0.52 % ) received notifications of irregular pulse .
among the 450 participants who returned ECG patches containing data that could be analyzed - which had been applied , on average , 13 days after notification - atrial fibrillation was present in 34 % ( 97.5 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 29 to 39 ) overall and in 35 % ( 97.5 % CI , 27 to 43 ) of participants 65 years of age or older .
among participants who were notified of an irregular pulse , the positive predictive value was 0.84 ( 95 % CI , 0.76 to 0.92 ) for observing atrial fibrillation on the ECG simultaneously with a subsequent irregular pulse notification and 0.71 ( 97.5 % CI , 0.69 to 0.74 ) for observing atrial fibrillation on the ECG simultaneously with a subsequent irregular tachogram .
of 1376 notified participants who returned a 90 @-@ day survey , 57 % contacted health care providers outside the study .
there were no reports of serious app @-@ related adverse events .
the probability of receiving an irregular pulse notification was low .
among participants who received notification of an irregular pulse , 34 % had atrial fibrillation on subsequent ECG patch readings and 84 % of notifications were concordant with atrial fibrillation .
this siteless ( no on @-@ site visits were required for the participants ) , pragmatic study design provides a foundation for large @-@ scale pragmatic studies in which outcomes or adherence can be reliably assessed with user @-@ owned devices . ( Funded by Apple ; Apple Heart Study ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT03335800 . )
wearable devices with optical sensors , such as smartwatches , are commonly used to measure wearers " pulse rates.1
algorithms that use pulse wave data to detect atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been developed.1,2
an Apple Watch application ( app ) can use intermittent , passively detected pulse rate data in an algorithm that identifies episodes suggestive of atrial fibrillation.3
the paroxysmal nature of atrial fibrillation may result in diagnostic delays since the electrocardiogram ( ECG ) can appear normal between episodes .
in addition , atrial fibrillation can be minimally symptomatic or clinically silent.7
approximately 700,000 people in the United States may have undiagnosed atrial fibrillation.8
continuous traditional heart monitors or implantable devices increase the detection of atrial fibrillation in populations at high risk7,9 @-@ 12 but have limited monitoring periods and require either invasive procedures or activation by the user .
the widespread use of Internet @-@ connected devices provides an opportunity to conduct large , siteless , pragmatic trials at a lower cost .
the goal of the Apple Heart Study was to evaluate the ability of an irregular pulse notification algorithm to identify atrial fibrillation with the use of an Apple Watch app by consumers .
details of the study have been described previously.13
this was a prospective , single @-@ group , open @-@ label , siteless , pragmatic study .
the research protocol was approved by the institutional review board at Stanford University and by a central institutional review board ( Advarra ) .
Apple sponsored the study and owns the data .
all study data are stored at Stanford on Stanford data platforms .
the analyses presented here were performed by Stanford quantitative scientists independent of the sponsor .
Stanford has the right to publish regardless of the outcome .
all the authors , including authors employed by the sponsor , reviewed and approved the manuscript and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data .
the app , which used the irregular pulse notification algorithm , was available in the United States for download from the Apple App Store from the time the study launched on November 29 , 2017 , until August 1 , 2018 .
major eligibility criteria included possession of a compatible Apple iPhone and Apple Watch , an age of 22 years or older , United States residency , and proficiency in English , as reported by the participant .
participants who reported previous atrial fibrillation or current use of oral anticoagulation agents were not eligible .
all participants provided electronically signed informed consent . ( the consent form , along with a description of the algorithm , telemedicine visit protocol , and methods used for tachogram sampling , are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. )
monitoring AND STUDY INTERVENTION
the study app was used to verify eligibility , obtain participants " consent , provide study education , and direct participants through the study procedures .
after a participant provided consent , the irregular pulse notification algorithm was activated .
the study used the Apple Watch photoplethysmography sensor , which used light @-@ emitting and light @-@ sensitive diodes to intermittently and passively measure changes in blood flow while participants were at rest .
participants were prompted to initiate a telemedicine visit directly from the app .
after the initial notification of an irregular pulse , subsequent tachograms and notifications were recorded but were not provided to the participant .
the notification feature was active until September 1 , 2018 .
study visits were conducted by physicians from a national telehealth servicer ( American Well ) with the use of a standardized protocol .
participants with urgent symptoms were directed to go to an urgent care clinic or emergency department .
participants whose eligibility was confirmed and whose symptoms were not urgent were mailed an ECG patch ( ePatch ) to wear for up to 7 days .
the ECG patches were returned by mail and initially examined by trained technicians .
participants with serious arrhythmias were contacted immediately and directed to seek urgent medical care .
the ECG patch reports were read by two clinicians , and discrepant interpretations were then reconciled by a committee of clinicians coordinated by the Stanford Center for Clinical Research .
in addition , 3 @-@ minute ECG strips from each patch , time @-@ aligned to sampled tachograms , were separately read by two clinicians , with disagreements resolved by a third clinician and then a committee , if necessary .
participants were prompted to initiate a second telemedicine visit to discuss the ambulatory ECG findings and were directed to subsequent care .
study @-@ visit physicians did not initiate treatments .
participants who received irregular pulse notifications were asked to complete a survey , included in the study app , 90 days after notification .
all enrolled participants , regardless of notification status , were directed to a Web @-@ based end @-@ of @-@ study survey to be completed by January 31 , 2019 .
all adverse events were reviewed by personnel at the study safety monitoring desk at the Stanford Center for Clinical Research .
there were two coprimary outcomes : atrial fibrillation of greater than 30 seconds " duration on ECG patch monitoring in a participant who received an irregular pulse notification , and simultaneous atrial fibrillation on ECG patch monitoring during intervals when the participant had an irregular tachogram .
key secondary outcomes were simultaneous atrial fibrillation on ECG patch monitoring when the pulse notification algorithm detected an irregular pulse and participant report of contact with a health care provider outside the study within 3 months after notification of an irregular pulse .
we calculated the minimum number of participants with analyzable data from ECG patches that would ensure sufficient precision to estimate both the proportion of atrial fibrillation detected in participants 65 years of age or older and the positive predictive value of the tachogram .
we targeted 503 ECG patches in each age group ( < 65 and ≥ 65 years ) , yielding 97.5 % confidence intervals around the atrial fibrillation yield for participants 65 years of age or older and a positive predictive value of tachograms no wider than 0.10 .
given the large volume and diversity of data , methods were applied so that key statistics presented were arrived at independently by at least two members of the data team to ensure reproducibility .
statistical analyses are described in the statistical analysis plan , which is included in the Supplementary Appendix .
means and standard deviations are provided for continuous characteristics , and frequency distributions with percentages are presented for binary and categorical characteristics .
for participants for whom key data were missing , we compared observed participant @-@ level characteristics of participants with missing values with characteristics of participants without missing values to help in interpreting key relationships .
the ECG patch subgroup included participants who received a notification , reported no history of atrial fibrillation before enrollment , were not receiving anticoagulant therapy , had no urgent symptoms at the first study visit , and wore their ECG patch within 14 days after shipment for at least 1 hour and returned it within 45 days after the first study visit .
we estimated the yield of atrial fibrillation for participants 65 years of age or older as the proportion who had confirmed atrial fibrillation on subsequent ECG patches .
we characterized the positive predictive value of the tachograms by calculating the proportion of sampled irregular tachograms for which atrial fibrillation was confirmed on simultaneous ECG patch strips .
we estimated the positive predictive value of the notification by calculating the proportion of participants with atrial fibrillation confirmed on at least one ECG strip that was simultaneous with the tachograms that led to the notification .
finally , we estimated the proportion of participants who reported contact with a health care provider among those who were notified and responded to the 90 @-@ day questionnaire .
confidence intervals for relevant quantities were provided on the basis of Gaussian assumptions or , if the Gaussian assumption yielded bounds that crossed 0 or 1 , on the bias @-@ corrected and accelerated bootstrap interval ; 97.5 % confidence intervals were provided for two key quantities ( the yield of atrial fibrillation for participants 65 years of age or older and the positive predictive value of the tachogram ) and 95 % confidence intervals were provided for other estimates .
during an 8 @-@ month period , 419,297 participants were recruited from 50 states and the District of Columbia ( Figure 1 ) .
baseline characteristics of the participants are summarized in Table 1 .
irregular PULSE NOTIFICATIONS
over a median monitoring time of 117 days ( interquartile range , 113 to 186 ) , irregular pulse notifications were received by 2161 participants ( 0.52 % ) , ranging from 3.1 % of those 65 years of age or older to 0.16 % of those 22 to 40 years of age ( Figure 2 ) .
atrial FIBRILLATION ON SUBSEQUENT AMBULATORY ECG MONITORING
among participants who received a notification , 450 ( 20.8 % of all notified ) returned an ECG patch , which was applied a mean ( ± SD ) of 13 ± 16 days after initial notification .
ECG patches were worn for an average of 6.3 days .
participants who returned ECG patches had baseline characteristics similar to the full cohort of participants who received a notification .
among the 450 participants who returned ECG patches , atrial fibrillation was identified in 153 , resulting in a diagnostic yield of atrial fibrillation on ECG patches of 34 % ( 97.5 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 29 to 39 ) ( Figure 3 ) .
the ECG patches worn by participants 65 years of age or older had a diagnostic yield of atrial fibrillation of 35 % ( 97.5 % CI , 27 to 43 ) , whereas among participants younger than 40 years of age , the diagnostic yield of atrial fibrillation was 18 % ( 95 % CI , 6 to 31 ) .
of the 20 participants who were urgently contacted , 18 had atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates greater than 200 beats per minute for more than 30 seconds , 1 had a pause lasting more than 6 seconds , and 1 had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia lasting more than 6 seconds .
positive PREDICTIVE VALUES
of the 6968 tachograms sampled for adjudication , 270 were excluded because they were not of sufficient quality to be read .
of the 2089 irregular tachograms sampled from participants who had received a notification for analysis , 1489 showed simultaneous atrial fibrillation on ECG patch monitoring , resulting in a positive predictive value of the individual tachogram of 0.71 ( 97.5 % CI , 0.69 to 0.74 ) .
for tachograms in the subgroup of participants 65 years of age or older , the positive predictive value was 0.60 ( 97.5 % CI , 0.56 to 0.64 ) .
in the 600 irregular tachograms without simultaneous atrial fibrillation on ECG patch monitoring , frequent premature atrial contractions ( 6 or more over a 3 @-@ minute period ) were identified in 77 % , frequent premature ventricular contractions ( 6 or more over a 3 @-@ minute period ) in 16 % , and atrial tachycardias ( 3 or more consecutive beats ) in 38 % .
the identification of these arrhythmias was not mutually exclusive .
sinus arrhythmia alone was found in 28 ( 4.7 % ) of the 600 irregular tachograms without atrial fibrillation .
of the 86 participants who had irregular pulse notifications during simultaneous use of an ECG patch , 72 showed evidence of atrial fibrillation on concurrent ECG patch strips .
this resulted in a positive predictive value for the irregular pulse notification of 0.84 ( 95 % CI , 0.76 to 0.92 ) among participants who had received an irregular pulse notification .
for irregular pulse notifications in participants 65 years of age or older , the positive predictive value was 0.78 ( 95 % CI , 0.64 to 0.92 ) .
90 @-@ DAY SURVEY
of the 2161 participants who received an irregular pulse notification , 1376 ( 64 % ) returned a 90 @-@ day survey .
of these , 787 ( 57 % ) reported contact with a health care provider outside the study , 28 % were prescribed a new medication , 33 % were recommended to see a specialist ( e.g. , a cardiologist ) , and 36 % were recommended to have additional testing .
in total , 1041 ( 76 % ) stated that they had contacted the study visit doctor , a health care provider outside the study , or both .
end @-@ OF @-@ STUDY SURVEY
of the 2161 participants who received a notification , 929 ( 43 % ) completed an end @-@ of @-@ study survey ; among 417,136 participants who never received a notification , 293,015 ( 70 % ) completed the survey ( Table 2 ) .
of those notified , 404 ( 44 % ) reported a new atrial fibrillation diagnosis , whereas among those who received no notification , 3070 ( 1.0 % ) reported a new atrial fibrillation diagnosis .
the notification subgroup reported a greater incidence of strokes , heart failure , and myocardial infarctions than did the non @-@ notification group .
the notification subgroup was also more likely to start receiving anticoagulant therapy or aspirin .
of the 404 notified participants who reported new atrial fibrillation , 95 ( 24 % ) reported undergoing cardioversion , 12 ( 3 % ) received an implantable loop recorder , 82 ( 20 % ) started antiarrhythmic therapy , and 71 ( 18 % ) underwent catheter ablation .
none of the adverse events related to the app resulted in hospitalization or urgent medical attention .
the Apple Heart Study was a prospective , single @-@ group study that was based on a siteless , pragmatic design .
of the 419,297 participants enrolled , only 0.52 % received an irregular pulse notification , and among those with an initial notification who returned an ECG patch , 84 % ( 95 % CI , 76 to 92 ) of their subsequent notifications were confirmed to be atrial fibrillation .
of participants 65 years of age and older , 3.2 % received notifications .
these estimates may help providers better understand the implications of irregular pulse notifications when patients present for clinical care .
the overall yield of atrial fibrillation on an ECG patch was 34 % among those who received notifications .
this finding is clinically relevant because these participants had a relatively high burden of atrial fibrillation , with a majority of episodes lasting more than 1 hour .
the index atrial fibrillation episode may have ended by the time the ECG patch was worn , which was , on average , 13 days after the initial notification .
although the percentage of participants younger than 40 years of age who received notifications ( 0.16 % ) was low , the atrial fibrillation yield on ECG patch monitoring in this group was also lower ( 18 % ) than in other age groups .
this may be a reflection of the paroxysmal nature of atrial fibrillation at the earlier stages of disease , but further studies are needed to better understand the public health implications of identifying irregular pulse in persons younger than 40 years of age .
the positive predictive value of an individual tachogram was 0.71 ( 97.5 % CI , 0.69 to 0.74 ) and the positive predictive value of an irregular pulse notification was 0.84 ( 95 % CI , 0.76 to 0.92 ) , which suggests that algorithms that rely on confirmation of multiple irregular tachograms before triggering a notification improve accuracy .
many of the irregular tachograms not adjudicated as atrial fibrillation were instead concordant with rhythms that may warrant further clinical attention and require additional study .
the positive predictive values were measured for participants who had already received an irregular pulse notification and are therefore only an estimate of the positive predictive value of an initial notification in the overall cohort .
this study also provides insight into the way digital alerts result in engagement with the health care system .
that 76 % of notified participants who returned a survey contacted either the telemedicine provider or a nonstudy provider suggests that many actively sought medical attention .
the remaining may have ignored the notification because they knew they had atrial fibrillation , were asymptomatic , did not trust the notification , or did not feel that the notification , even if true , required follow @-@ up .
there are several limitations to the study .
participants did not initiate contact with the study provider after notification and fewer returned ECG patches ( 450 of 2161 notified ) than anticipated .
as a result , the targeted statistical precision for estimating the yield of atrial fibrillation on patch monitoring , which was one of our primary end points , was not met .
the reported confidence intervals appropriately reflect the uncertainty of our key quantities of interest among participants who returned their ECG patches ; however , the generalizability of these estimates to participants who did not return ECG patches remains uncertain .
nevertheless , no qualitative differences were observed between those notified and excluded from the analysis and those notified who provided ECG patches with data that could be analyzed .
the study was not designed to assess the algorithm as a screening tool or to measure sensitivity , specificity , or false positive results .
the algorithm was designed to minimize false positive findings , 3 and the low incidence of notifications reflects this intent .
furthermore , the algorithm was not designed to detect short episodes of atrial fibrillation , and participants with a low burden of atrial fibrillation could have been missed .
the study objective was not to address the use of the Apple Watch as a population screening tool .
patients using this technology should be aware that the absence of an irregular pulse notification does not exclude possible arrhythmias .
conversely , notification based on an irregular pulse from a photoplethysmography signal should not be used for a definitive diagnosis of atrial fibrillation .
since rhythm @-@ detection technologies are rapidly evolving , additional studies using features such as wearable ECG monitoring devices will need to be performed as the technology becomes available .
nevertheless , uncertainty remains about the benefits of diagnosing and treating asymptomatic atrial fibrillation , particularly in persons whose episodes of atrial fibrillation are of 6 hours " duration or less .
there was no direct physical contact with participants from the time of enrollment and consent to interaction with the telemedicine provider and ECG patch monitoring .
although our siteless , pragmatic study design allowed us to enroll more than 400,000 participants in 8 months , we relied on the participants " assessments regarding their eligibility for inclusion and regarding outcomes .
substantial loss to follow @-@ up results in uncertain validity and generalizability inherent to this design .
at enrollment , persons with previous atrial fibrillation were asked not to participate , but several participants who received notifications later reported a history of atrial fibrillation .
although we mitigated this misclassification by verifying enrollment criteria at the study visit , this kind of misclassification illustrates the challenges of relying on the participants themselves to assess enrollment eligibility and outcomes .
in the future , studies may be able to leverage health record data directly from smartphones .
as the number of app @-@ based studies grows , development of methods to maximize engagement and the accuracy of data reported by participants is an important area of investigation .
although the participants we enrolled were geographically , racially , and ethnically diverse , the cohort was skewed toward a younger demographic , reflective of smartwatch owners .
studies using similar designs will need to consider these factors to ensure that all affected age and socioeconomic groups are represented .
we found that the probability that a participant was notified of an irregular pulse was low , but among participants who were notified of an irregular pulse , more than one third had atrial fibrillation identified on a subsequently worn ECG patch monitor , and among those notified who returned an ECG patch , positive notifications were concordant with atrial fibrillation 84 % ( 95 % CI , 76 to 92 ) of the time .
we believe that these data support the ability of the algorithm to correctly identify atrial fibrillation in users whom it notifies of irregular pulses .
rigorous investigation of this technology and of its use in a clinical setting is needed , including the ways this technology can guide further evaluation and treatment to improve clinical outcomes .
finally , this study provides a foundation on which further research in digital health can be conducted .
pooled observational data help shape cardiovascular disease risk stratification as a function of age at menopause .
hazard ratios ( HRs ) were adjusted for body @-@ mass index , smoking status , hypertension , postmenopausal hormone therapy ( HT ) , education , and ethnicity .
in this cohort , mean and median ages at menopause were 50.2 years and 50.0 years , respectively .
compared with the reference group , premature menopause ( HR , 1.52 ) , early menopause ( HR , 1.30 ) , and relatively early menopause ( HR , 1.13 ) were associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease .
similar associations were seen for stroke ( premature [ HR , 1.72 ] , early [ HR , 1.32 ] , relatively early [ HR 1.09 ] ; P < 0.0001 for all comparisons ) .
these associations persisted after controlling for smoking , use of hormone therapy , and family history of cardiovascular disease .
excess risk was highest before age 60 but was not apparent after age 70 .
this large observational study demonstrates that premature and early menopause are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease .
surprisingly , this excess risk was also seen in nonsmokers and women receiving hormone therapy .
age at menopause should be included in the assessment of cardiovascular risk .
but intervention patients reduced calorie consumption by only about 100 calories daily .
following a Mediterranean diet is associated with lower risk for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases , but adherence often is poor .
in this randomized trial , researchers assessed the effect on diet adherence of an intensive behavioral and lifestyle counseling program among 6874 community @-@ dwelling Spanish patients with metabolic syndrome ( mean age , 65 ; mean body @-@ mass index , 33 kg / m2 ) .
diet and lifestyle behaviors were assessed at baseline .
intervention participants received 36 educational encounters during the 12 @-@ month study ( i.e. , group and individual counseling sessions and telephone calls ) , and control patients received 6 such encounters .
all participants received free extra @-@ virgin olive oil and nuts .
at 12 @-@ month follow @-@ up , validated measures of overall dietary adherence were significantly better , energy consumption was roughly 100 calories per day lower , and weight was lower by roughly 2 kg ( mean loss , 3 kg vs. 1 kg ) in the intervention versus the control group .
the authors describe this report as a preliminary analysis of adherence , with further assessments of cardiovascular risk factors to come .
the improved adherence is a positive outcome but is not surprising for an intervention that involves 6 times more educational and motivational contact .
that this level of counseling intensity resulted in so little calorie reduction and weight loss is disappointing .
a panel suggests that adults may continue to consume unprocessed red meat and processed meat without incurring excess health risks .
sponsoring Organization : nutritional Recommendations ( NutriRECS ) international consortium
current dietary guidelines implicate unprocessed red meat and processed meat in conferring adverse cardiovascular ( CV ) and cancer outcomes .
the panel 's evaluation produced the following summary results :
meta @-@ analysis of the 12 RCTs showed no significant difference between patients who consumed higher versus lower quantities of red meat during longer than 10 years of follow @-@ up for the outcomes of all @-@ cause mortality , CV @-@ related mortality , CV disease , or cancer @-@ related mortality , including colorectal cancer ( low- to very low @-@ certainty evidence ) .
key Recommendation : adults may continue consumption of unprocessed red meat and processed meat ( weak recommendation , based on low @-@ certainty evidence ) .
this nutrition guideline - which generated intense controversy - systematically incorporates comprehensive evidence of the effects of unprocessed red meat and processed meat consumption on clinical outcomes .
recommendations are weak and based on low @-@ certainty evidence .
greater reductions in meat consumption than the " practical " 3 servings @-@ per @-@ week reductions evaluated here might yield greater reductions in adverse outcomes .
for people who are interested in reducing meat consumption ( whether to improve health or mitigate the effects of meat production on the environment ) , certainly nothing in this guideline argues against that lifestyle modification .
updated ATS / IDSA guidelines include several important changes from the 2007 guidelines .
sponsoring Organizations : the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Disease Society of America
target Audience : general internists , family practitioners , emergency department physicians , hospitalists , intensivists , infectious disease specialists , pulmonary specialists
this update of the 2007 community @-@ acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) guidelines involves a more evidence @-@ based approach and includes 16 management questions addressing initial diagnosis through therapy completion and follow @-@ up .
unchanged recommendations include :
obtain Legionella and pneumococcal urinary antigen assays only in patients with severe CAP or epidemiologic risk factors .
do not add anaerobic coverage routinely for suspected aspiration pneumonia .
test for and treat influenza during influenza season .
additional clinical issues addressed in the new guidelines are :
do not use serum procalcitonin levels to determine initiation or duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with radiographically confirmed CAP unless antibiotic therapy is being extended beyond 5 to 7 days .
do not routinely treat with corticosteroids except in patients with concurrent refractory septic shock .
recommendations have been expanded for collection of sputum and blood cultures from patients with severe disease to also include any inpatient receiving empiric coverage for methicillin @-@ resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
amoxicillin has been added as a firstline agent for healthy outpatient adults ; use of macrolide monotherapy is now restricted to outpatients where local pneumococcal resistance to macrolides is < 25 % .
the concept of healthcare @-@ associated pneumonia ( HCAP ) has been eliminated .
for severe CAP , use of a β @-@ lactam agent plus a macrolide is now favored over a β @-@ lactam agent and a respiratory fluoroquinolone .
as the authors note , the recommendation to routinely cover MRSA and P. aeruginosa in patients with HCAP in the 2007 guidelines led to marked increases in use of vancomycin and antipseudomonal β @-@ lactam agents without notable clinical benefit .
thus , the most important change is to markedly narrow the population in which these pathogens should be treated .
the guidelines leave unresolved the issue of fluoroquinolone use given recent concerns by the FDA , and do not address testing for or management of viral pathogens other than influenza that have been implicated increasingly in CAP .
income drops of greater than 50 % were independently associated with incident cardiovascular disease in a longitudinal cohort study .
the inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is well documented , with higher income ( a commonly used proxy for higher socioeconomic status ) associated with a lower risk for incident CVD .
however , few studies have considered the effects of changes in income .
using data from the ongoing , prospective , cohort study , Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ( ARIC ) , researchers grouped 8989 participants ( mean age , 53 ; 20 % black ; 57 % women ) into categories based on changes in household income over a mean period of 6 years .
participants were without prevalent stroke , heart failure , or myocardial infarction ( MI ) .
incident CVD was defined as MI , fatal coronary heart disease , incident heart failure , or stroke .
most participants did not have a significant change in income ( 70 % ) , whereas 10 % experienced an income drop , and 20 % experienced an income rise .
participants were followed for CVD events for a mean of 17 years , and analyses adjusted for baseline income , sociodemographic factors , health behaviors , and CVD biomarkers .
participants who experienced a > 50 % income drop in the 6 @-@ year follow @-@ up had higher incident CVD at the long @-@ term follow @-@ up ( hazard ratio , 1.17 ) than those with relatively unchanged income ; those who had a > 50 % income rise were less likely to develop CVD ( HR , 0.86 ) .
the authors are commended for exploring the association between changes in socioeconomic status and incident CVD .
like all CVD risk factors , income is not static ; changes in income matter and should be considered .
however , because of residual confounding and possible reverse causation , the mechanisms linking a drop in income with CVD remain unclear .
public @-@ health interventions aimed at CVD prevention should address social determinants of health , including financial security .
in an observational study , optimism was associated significantly with attaining age 85 .
many genetic , sociodemographic , and lifestyle factors influence longevity .
participants also completed validated instruments that measure optimism .
in both sexes , higher optimism levels correlated with increased longevity , with a dose @-@ response relation , after adjustment for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and coexisting health conditions .
study participants with the highest levels of optimism had 50 % ( for women ) and 70 % ( for men ) higher likelihood of surviving to age 85 , compared with women and men with the lowest optimism levels .
given the number of study participants , the meticulous detail with which the relevant data were prospectively collected , and the long duration of observation , these results appear to be robust : optimism is associated independently with longevity , after adjustment for potentially confounding factors .
the results raise the " chicken or the egg " question : does good health breed optimism , or does optimism improve longevity ?
the authors favor the latter theory .
but , if optimism can improve longevity , so what ?
the authors cite studies showing that brief interventions can enhance optimism , at least in the short term .
that does not mean that such interventions will extend life , but the hypothesis is worth testing .
individualized risk assessment might help determine whether a patient could benefit from aspirin .
recently published negative studies have tempered enthusiasm for using aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ; NEJM JW Gen Med Jan 1 2019 ) .
now , researchers in New Zealand have attempted to identify subgroups of patients for whom benefits of aspirin might outweigh harms .
first , they derived models showing actual observed 5 @-@ year rates of CVD and bleeding - according to individualized risk predictors - in a large primary care cohort ( age range , 30 @-@ 79 ) without aspirin use .
then , they estimated the extent to which aspirin might lower CVD risk and confer bleeding risk in 250,000 patients in their database ; these estimates were based on assumptions ( taken from a previously published meta @-@ analysis ; NEJM JW Gen Med Mar 1 2019 and JAMA 2019 ; 321 : 277 ) that aspirin confers an 11 % relative reduction in CVD risk , and a relative 43 % increase in risk for major bleeding .
if hospitalization or death due to an acute CVD event is considered equivalent to hospitalization or death due to an acute major bleed , only patients with very high CVD risk and low bleeding risk would gain a net benefit from aspirin therapy .
in this New Zealand cohort , 1 in 40 women ( 2.5 % ) and 1 in 8 men ( 12 % ) fell into this category .
this study confirms that most patients do not benefit from for primary preventive aspirin .
it does suggest that a small minority of patients at high CVD risk and low bleeding risk might still benefit , but even among patients with favorable benefit / harm balance , the probability of benefit is tiny ( 4 per 1000 in the example above ) .
in addition , we don 't know how this model would perform in non @-@ New Zealand populations .
in an early @-@ phase study involving patients with advanced non @-@ small @-@ cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , the response rate was better with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with nivolumab monotherapy , particularly among patients with tumors that expressed programmed death ligand 1 ( PD @-@ L1 ) .
data are needed to assess the long @-@ term benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with NSCLC .
all the patients had received no previous chemotherapy .
the primary end point reported here was overall survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab as compared with chemotherapy in patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more .
among the patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more , the median duration of overall survival was 17.1 months ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 15.0 to 20.1 ) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 14.9 months ( 95 % CI , 12.7 to 16.7 ) with chemotherapy ( P = 0.007 ) , with 2 @-@ year overall survival rates of 40.0 % and 32.8 % , respectively .
the median duration of response was 23.2 months with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 6.2 months with chemotherapy .
the overall survival benefit was also observed in patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of less than 1 % , with a median duration of 17.2 months ( 95 % CI , 12.8 to 22.0 ) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 12.2 months ( 95 % CI , 9.2 to 14.3 ) with chemotherapy .
among all the patients in the trial , the median duration of overall survival was 17.1 months ( 95 % CI , 15.2 to 19.9 ) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 13.9 months ( 95 % CI , 12.2 to 15.1 ) with chemotherapy .
the percentage of patients with grade 3 or 4 treatment @-@ related adverse events in the overall population was 32.8 % with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 36.0 % with chemotherapy .
first @-@ line treatment with nivolumab plus ipilimumab resulted in a longer duration of overall survival than did chemotherapy in patients with NSCLC , independent of the PD @-@ L1 expression level .
no new safety concerns emerged with longer follow @-@ up . ( Funded by Bristol @-@ Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical ; CheckMate 227 ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT02477826 . )
substantial progress has been made in the first @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced non @-@ small @-@ cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) without driver alterations that can be targeted .
these treatments include monotherapy blockade of programmed death 1 ( PD @-@ 1 ) in patients with tumors that express programmed death ligand 1 ( PD @-@ L1 ) or such treatment in combination with chemotherapy , regardless of tumor PD @-@ L1 expression.1 @-@ 7
still , current therapies extend long @-@ term survival in only a minority of patients with NSCLC .
nivolumab , a fully human anti @-@ PD @-@ 1 antibody , and ipilimumab , a fully human anti @-@ cytotoxic T @-@ lymphocyte antigen 4 ( CTLA @-@ 4 ) antibody , are immune checkpoint inhibitors with distinct but complementary mechanisms of action .
combination therapy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab has resulted in longer overall survival than previous standard therapies in patients with melanoma8 and in those with renal @-@ cell carcinoma.9
in a phase 1 study involving patients with NSCLC , the response rate was better with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with nivolumab monotherapy , particularly among patients with PD @-@ L1 @-@ expressing tumors.10
decreasing the dose and frequency of administration of ipilimumab ( 1 mg per kilogram of body weight every 6 weeks ) when combined with nivolumab resulted in fewer adverse events than other ipilimumab regimens while maintaining improved efficacy in patients with NSCLC.10
in CheckMate 227 , a randomized , open @-@ label , phase 3 trial , we evaluated nivolumab or nivolumab @-@ based regimens as first @-@ line treatment for advanced NSCLC .
part 1 of the trial has two independent primary end points .
we reported the primary end point of progression @-@ free survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab , as compared with chemotherapy , in patients with a high tumor mutational burden ( ≥ 10 mutations per megabase ) previously.11
here , we report the primary end point of overall survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab , as compared with chemotherapy , in patients with a tumor PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more .
eligibility criteria for CheckMate 227 have been described previously.11
patients were adults with squamous or nonsquamous stage IV or recurrent NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance @-@ status score of 0 or 1 ( on a 5 @-@ point scale , with higher scores indicating greater disability ) .12
none of the patients had received previous systemic anticancer therapy for advanced or metastatic disease .
key exclusion criteria were the presence of EGFR mutations or known ALK translocations sensitive to targeted therapy , autoimmune disease , or untreated or symptomatic central nervous system metastases .
details regarding the eligibility criteria are provided in the Methods section of the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org .
we screened pretreatment tumor tissue ( freshly collected or archived ≤ 6 months before enrollment ) for tumor PD @-@ L1 expression.13
patients who had PD @-@ L1 expression in 1 % or more of tumor cells were enrolled in Part 1a of the trial , and those with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of less than 1 % were enrolled in Part 1b .
in Part 1a , patients were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to receive nivolumab ( at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks ) plus ipilimumab ( at a dose of 1 mg per kilogram every 6 weeks ) , nivolumab monotherapy ( 240 mg every 2 weeks ) , or platinum @-@ doublet chemotherapy every 3 weeks for up to four cycles .
in Part 1b , patients were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 : 1 ratio to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab , nivolumab ( 360 mg every 3 weeks ) plus platinum @-@ doublet chemotherapy ( every 3 weeks for up to four cycles ) , or platinum @-@ doublet chemotherapy alone ( every 3 weeks for up to four cycles ) .
details regarding tissue requirements for PD @-@ L1 screening and chemotherapy regimens are provided in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix .
treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or , for the immunotherapy regimens , until 2 years of follow @-@ up .
patients who received immunotherapy regimens could continue to receive treatment beyond disease progression if they met prespecified criteria , as described in the Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix .
crossover between the treatment groups during the trial was not permitted .
subsequent therapy was determined at the physician 's discretion .
the primary end point reported here is overall survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab , as compared with chemotherapy , in patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more .
hierarchical secondary end points were progression @-@ free survival , according to blinded independent central review ; overall survival with nivolumab plus chemotherapy , as compared with chemotherapy alone , in patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of less than 1 % ; and overall survival with nivolumab monotherapy , as compared with chemotherapy , in patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 50 % or more .
prespecified analyses that were not part of the statistical testing hierarchy are descriptive ( Table S1 ) .
we determined the PD @-@ L1 expression level13 and tumor mutational burden11,14 @-@ 16 as described previously .
adverse events were assessed by the investigator and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events , version 4.0 .
one of the sponsors ( Bristol @-@ Myers Squibb ) and a steering committee designed the trial and analyzed the data , with the participation of all the authors .
the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each center approved the trial .
the trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines .
an independent data and safety monitoring committee provided oversight of efficacy and safety .
all the authors attest that the trial was conducted in accordance with the protocol ( available at NEJM.org ) and vouch for the accuracy of the data .
the manuscript was developed with medical writing support funded by the sponsor .
we planned to enroll 1200 patients for randomization into the three treatment groups in Part 1a .
for the primary end point of overall survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab , as compared with chemotherapy , among the patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more , we determined that a sample size of 800 patients ( with 553 deaths ) would provide a power of 90 % to detect a hazard ratio of 0.74 at a two @-@ sided significance level of 2.5 % .
analyses of all other end points were also descriptive .
we performed Kaplan @-@ Meier analysis to estimate the duration of overall survival and progression @-@ free survival , along with the duration of response .
we used a nonparametric log @-@ rank test to assess the primary and secondary hierarchical end points and a stratified Cox proportional @-@ hazards model , with the treatment group as a single covariate , to calculate hazard ratios for death with associated two @-@ sided confidence intervals ( which were 97.72 % confidence intervals for end points tested in the statistical hierarchy ) .
if the proportional assumption was not met , hazard ratios were still reported to provide a conventional estimate of overall average effect and supplemented by median and landmark estimates .
for objective response rates , we used the Clopper @-@ Pearson method to calculate 95 % exact two @-@ sided confidence intervals .
this report is based on the final analysis of overall survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab , as compared with chemotherapy , in patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more , as of the database lock of July 2 , 2019 .
from August 2015 through November 2016 , a total of 2876 patients were enrolled in CheckMate 227 Part 1 ; of these patients , 1739 underwent randomization .
the main reason for exclusion was not meeting the trial criteria .
of the 1189 patients who had a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more , 396 were assigned to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab , 396 to receive nivolumab monotherapy , and 397 to receive chemotherapy .
of the 550 patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of less than 1 % , 187 were assigned to receive nivolumab plus ipilimumab , 177 to receive nivolumab plus chemotherapy , and 186 to receive chemotherapy .
the minimum follow @-@ up for overall survival was 29.3 months .
trial @-@ group assignments are summarized in Figure S2 and Table S3 .
the characteristics of the patients were balanced across the treatment groups at baseline ( Table 1 and Tables S4 and S5 ) .
among the patients who had disease progression during the trial , subsequent systemic therapy was administered in 43.6 % of the patients who had received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and in 55.8 % of those who had received chemotherapy ; immunotherapy was administered in 42.4 % of those in the chemotherapy group .
data regarding treatment duration , number of doses , and subsequent therapies within PD @-@ L1 subgroups and in all patients are provided in Tables S6 , S7 , and S8 .
efficacy OF NIVOLUMAB PLUS IPILIMUMAB AS COMPARED WITH CHEMOTHERAPY
in patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more , the median duration of overall survival was 17.1 months ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 15.0 to 20.1 ) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 14.9 months ( 95 % CI , 12.7 to 16.7 ) with chemotherapy ( P = 0.007 ) ( Figure 1A ) .
overall survival rates at 1 year and 2 years were 62.6 % and 40.0 % , respectively , with nivolumab plus ipilimumab , as compared with 56.2 % and 32.8 % , respectively , with chemotherapy .
the rate of overall survival was significantly higher among the patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab than among those who received chemotherapy , but the proportional @-@ hazards assumption was not met .
the hazard ratio for death of 0.79 ( 97.72 % confidence interval , 0.65 to 0.96 ) ( Table S2 ) provides an overall estimate of benefit and should be interpreted in the context of the shape of the curves , which are characterized by transient initial survival benefit with chemotherapy , followed by long @-@ term benefit with nivolumab plus ipilimumab .
overall survival in most subgroups favored nivolumab plus ipilimumab ( Figure 1B ) ; the exceptions were patients with liver metastases and those who had never smoked .
the objective response rate was 35.9 % ( 95 % CI , 31.1 to 40.8 ) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab ( with 5.8 % of patients having a complete response ) versus 30.0 % ( 95 % CI , 25.5 to 34.7 ) with chemotherapy ( with 1.8 % of patients having a complete response ) ( Table S9 ) .
the median duration of response was 23.2 months ( 95 % CI , 15.2 to 32.2 ) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 6.2 months ( 95 % CI , 5.6 to 7.4 ) with chemotherapy .
we further evaluated nivolumab plus ipilimumab , as compared with chemotherapy , in a prespecified descriptive analysis of patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of less than 1 % and in all the trial patients .
in patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of less than 1 % , the median duration of overall survival was longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab ( 17.2 months ; 95 % CI , 12.8 to 22.0 ) than with chemotherapy ( 12.2 months ; 95 % CI , 9.2 to 14.3 ) , with a hazard ratio for death of 0.62 ( 95 % CI , 0.48 to 0.78 ) ( Figure 2A ) .
the 2 @-@ year overall survival rates were 40.4 % for nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 23.0 % for chemotherapy .
secondary END POINTS IN HIERARCHICAL TESTING
among the patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of less than 1 % , the rate of progression @-@ free survival was significantly higher with nivolumab plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone ( 10.5 % vs. 4.6 % at 2 years ; hazard ratio for disease progression or death , 0.73 ; 97.72 % CI , 0.56 to 0.95 ; P = 0.007 ) .
the median duration of overall survival was 15.2 months ( 95 % CI , 12.3 to 19.8 ) with nivolumab plus chemotherapy and 12.2 months ( 95 % CI , 9.2 to 14.3 ) with chemotherapy alone .
thus , formal statistical testing of the one remaining secondary end point was not conducted .
efficacy OF NIVOLUMAB PLUS IPILIMUMAB AS COMPARED WITH NIVOLUMAB MONOTHERAPY AND NIVOLUMAB PLUS CHEMOTHERAPY
in patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more , the rate of overall survival at 2 years was 40.0 % with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 36.2 % with nivolumab monotherapy .
in patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 50 % or more , the 2 @-@ year overall survival rate was 48.1 % and 41.9 % , respectively .
the percentage of patients who had a complete response with nivolumab plus ipilimumab , as compared with nivolumab monotherapy , was 5.8 % and 3.0 % , respectively , among the patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more and 8.8 % and 4.7 % , respectively , among those with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 50 % or more .
the median duration of response was 23.2 months ( 95 % CI , 15.2 to 32.2 ) with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 15.5 months ( 95 % CI , 12.7 to 23.5 ) with nivolumab monotherapy among the patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more ; among those with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 50 % or more , the median duration of response was 31.8 months ( 95 % CI , 18.7 to not reached ) and 17.5 months ( 95 % CI , 13.5 to 31.0 ) , respectively .
the objective response rate was 27.3 % with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 37.9 % with nivolumab plus chemotherapy .
at 2 years , the overall survival rate was 40.4 % and 34.7 % , respectively .
the median duration of response was longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with nivolumab plus chemotherapy ( 18.0 months vs. 8.3 months ) .
effect OF PD @-@ L1 EXPRESSION AND TUMOR MUTATIONAL BURDEN
an overall survival benefit with nivolumab plus ipilimumab , as compared with chemotherapy , was observed regardless of the subgroup of PD @-@ L1 expression level .
exploratory analysis of additional PD @-@ L1 expression thresholds that are currently used for selection of anti @-@ PD @-@ 1 monotherapy showed more variable benefit ( Figure 3 ) .
among the 679 patients ( 58.2 % ) in whom the tumor mutational burden was evaluated , a similar degree of overall survival benefit was observed in patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab , regardless of whether they had a high tumor mutational burden or a low tumor mutational burden ( ≥ 10 vs. < 10 mutations per megabase , respectively ) , despite the previous observation of improved progression @-@ free survival in patients with a high tumor mutational burden.11
combining the two key biomarkers ( PD @-@ L1 expression level and tumor mutational burden ) did not identify a subgroup that had an increased magnitude of benefit with nivolumab plus ipilimumab over chemotherapy , although the sample sizes become more modest in these analyses .
data regarding adverse events for all the patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab or chemotherapy are provided in Table 2 .
the frequency of grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were determined by the investigator to be related to the trial treatment was similar in the group that received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and in the chemotherapy group ( 32.8 % vs. 36.0 % ) .
treatment @-@ related serious adverse events of any grade were more common with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy ( 24.5 % vs. 13.9 % ) , as were treatment @-@ related adverse events leading to discontinuation ( 18.1 % vs. 9.1 % ) .
the most common treatment @-@ related select adverse events of any grade with a potential immunologic cause in the group that received nivolumab plus ipilimumab were skin reactions ( in 34.0 % of the patients ) and endocrine events ( in 23.8 % ) ( Table S10 ) .
treatment @-@ related deaths occurred in 8 patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and in 6 patients who received chemotherapy ( Table 2 ) .
the adverse events that were associated with nivolumab plus ipilimumab and chemotherapy according to PD @-@ L1 expression level were similar to the adverse events in the overall population ( Table S11 ) , were consistent with those in previous trials , 10,11 and the incidence did not increase with longer follow @-@ up.11
among the 391 patients who had a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more who were treated with nivolumab monotherapy , grade 3 or 4 treatment @-@ related adverse events occurred in 76 patients ( 19.4 % ) , and treatment @-@ related adverse events of any grade resulted in discontinuation in 48 patients ( 12.3 % ) .
two treatment @-@ related deaths occurred in the nivolumab monotherapy group .
among the patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of less than 1 % , fewer grade 3 or 4 treatment @-@ related adverse events or serious adverse events were reported with nivolumab plus ipilimumab ( 27.0 % with adverse events and 16.2 % with serious adverse events ) than with nivolumab plus chemotherapy ( 55.8 % and 19.2 % , respectively ) .
in this subgroup , 3 treatment @-@ related deaths occurred in the group that received nivolumab plus ipilimumab and 4 in the group that received nivolumab plus chemotherapy .
in this phase 3 , randomized trial , we found that patients with advanced NSCLC and a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab had a significantly longer duration of overall survival than those who received chemotherapy as first @-@ line treatment .
at 2 years , the response rate was 49 % with nivolumab plus ipilimumab , as compared with 11 % with chemotherapy .
the safety of nivolumab plus ipilimumab has been improved in patients with NSCLC with the use of a lower dose and frequency of administration of ipilimumab , as was suggested in the phase 1 dose @-@ finding study.10
in addition , the duration of overall survival was longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy in all the trial patients , including in those with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of less than 1 % , a population for whom anti @-@ PD @-@ 1 monotherapy has been insufficient .
although the relative benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab , as compared with chemotherapy , was numerically greater in patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of less than 1 % than in those with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more , this result was mostly due to variations in median rates of survival with chemotherapy between the PD @-@ L1 subgroups .
the median duration of overall survival and rates of overall survival at 1 year and 2 years with nivolumab plus ipilimumab were nearly identical in these two PD @-@ L1 subgroups .
this result is consistent with previous reports involving patients with melanoma and renal @-@ cell carcinoma , which also showed a benefit for nivolumab plus ipilimumab regardless of PD @-@ L1 level.8,9
the precise underpinnings of the diminished dependence on PD @-@ L1 expression with a combination of PD @-@ 1 and CTLA @-@ 4 inhibition , as compared with anti @-@ PD @-@ 1 monotherapy , are unknown .
however , we hypothesize that the differential immune effects of CTLA @-@ 4 versus PD @-@ 1 inhibition17,18 may be particularly critical in PD @-@ L1 @-@ negative tumors for recruiting effective antitumor immunity from the peripheral compartment , which is increasingly recognized as an important mechanism of response to immunotherapy.19 @-@ 21
combining nivolumab with ipilimumab has proved to be effective in melanoma and renal @-@ cell carcinoma in previous studies , 8,9,22 yet a key question before this trial was whether the addition of CTLA @-@ 4 inhibition to PD @-@ 1 blockade contributes to benefit in patients with NSCLC .
although this trial was not powered to compare the two regimens , our findings show better efficacy with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with nivolumab monotherapy within the same trial .
in particular , we observed higher rates of complete response and a longer median duration of response ( a difference of > 7 months ) in the patients who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab .
in addition , among the patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression level of less than 1 % , those who received nivolumab plus ipilimumab had longer overall survival and a longer duration of response ( a difference of nearly 10 months ) than did those who received nivolumab plus chemotherapy , although this analysis was not part of the statistical testing hierarchy .
biomarkers for predicting an enhanced benefit for combination immunotherapy relative to chemotherapy remain elusive .
the design of this trial was informed by phase 1 and 2 single @-@ group studies of nivolumab plus ipilimumab that showed increased response rates in patients with PD @-@ L1 @-@ expressing tumors or a high tumor mutational burden in patients with NSCLC.10,23
however , in this large , randomized study , the survival benefit with nivolumab plus ipilimumab over chemotherapy was ultimately similar in the two main PD @-@ L1 subgroups on the basis of a cutoff of 1 % of tumor cells .
moreover , based on emerging data related to the tumor mutational burden as a biomarker , CheckMate 227 was amended to add a primary end point of progression @-@ free survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy in patients with a high tumor mutational burden.11
in the current report , although absolute survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab was greatest in patients with a high tumor mutational burden , a similar relative benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab , as compared with chemotherapy , was seen in patients regardless of tumor mutational burden .
the unexpected effect of the tumor mutational burden on the overall survival of patients who received chemotherapy may have contributed to these results .
before we initiated this trial , some24 @-@ 27 but not all28 studies had shown that survival was not affected by tumor mutational burden with chemotherapy treatment .
further understanding of the role of the tumor mutational burden , if any , as a biomarker is warranted before the integration of this factor into clinical practice .
in the primary analysis from this trial , the median duration of overall survival was significantly longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy among patients with advanced NSCLC who had a PD @-@ L1 expression level of 1 % or more .
in secondary analyses , the duration of overall survival was also longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than with chemotherapy in patients with a PD @-@ L1 expression of less than 1 % and in all the trial patients .
when I recall my house job ( internship ) , I remember fatigue and camaraderie .
I called it " the den . "
on first approach , the den could have been mistaken for the ICU , with white coats hung at its entrance as if they were prohibited from entering .
indistinguishable from one another , the coats all held a folded stethoscope in one pocket and the yellow Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine in the other .
if you took someone else 's coat by mistake , it scarcely mattered ; we were all cut from the same cloth .
in a sense , the den was an ICU - a site of intensive care for the hospital staff , a place to unload after another intense day of work .
it was also a place where ranks were temporarily forgotten and gradients were abolished - it was egalitarianism in practice .
we knew each other by name and by our preferred drinks .
in the small , stuffy , utterly undecorated room , clusters of people formed for no particular reason .
the den wasn 't divided into doctors and nurses or residents and attendings or surgeons and internists .
everyone spoke with everyone .
when you joined a group , it was good manners to buy everyone a round of drinks , though this etiquette was waived for radiologists , who , as the most important people in the hospital , never bought drinks .
by all objective indicators , I should have been unhappy in those grueling months I spent as a medical house officer .
the town was dreary , even by British standards , and had a limited range of restaurants .
like most junior doctors , I lived on the hospital campus in free housing that pushed minimalism to its limits .
one of our many hardships was the difficulty of maintaining a comfortable room temperature during the winter nights .
the den was an escape , a redoubt where we reflected and planned and spoke about our patients - what else , after all , was there to talk about ?
education was delivered informally over banter and beer .
I learned more medicine in the den than in all the grand rounds I 've ever attended .
as was typical in the National Health Service , the hospital was run by the junior doctors .
in the den we gave and received feedback about the patients we 'd been consulted on .
the surgical resident would tell me about the patient I thought had pancreatitis who didn 't and the patient I didn 't think had pancreatitis who did .
I found that nothing disrupted our usual silos more effectively than socializing with each other .
the den was ground zero for teamwork .
we spoke about our diagnostic failures and our therapeutic successes .
the first time I treated acute left ventricular failure in the middle of the night on my own , I couldn 't wait to tell my colleagues in the den .
I exaggerated my heroism with theatrical flair , my hyperbole attenuating my fatigue .
I looked forward to being on call again to gather more stories for the den .
we seldom spoke ill of our colleagues - they stood beside us , where we saw that we were shadows of one another .
we recognized that camaraderie isn 't just about sharing experiences ; it 's about seeing in others reflections of oneself .
clinical inquisitiveness was democratized .
porters ( orderlies ) would ask about patients who had coded , whose blood samples they 'd transported urgently to the pathology lab .
" did she make it ?
well , you did your best , doc . "
we were all on the same team , and their souls were nurtured by knowing the outcomes of the patients they served but never knew .
once , seeing my melancholy , the ward sister ( charge nurse ) came up to me in the den and reassured me that many interns fumble when first placing a peripheral line .
my screw @-@ up earlier that day wasn 't the cause of my sadness , but I instantly felt better knowing that she cared enough to notice ; in such cases , nailing the precise diagnosis isn 't as important as recognizing that there 's a problem .
when I successfully placed my first central line , she announced it in the den and told everyone to buy me a drink .
a mother figure , she watched me mature as a doctor , and I was better for being watched .
of course , the den wasn 't heaven ; it was more like hell averted , a holding zone saving us from the inferno .
Medicine can be lonely and brutal , but though we were all uniquely alone , we were not unique in being alone , and the den 's communal ethos mitigated our loneliness .
we became each other 's friends and therapists .
with no smartphones to distract us , we made eye contact when we spoke .
we passed along information about our patients in cursive on loose sheets of paper and napkins .
once , a fellow intern was about to leave for holiday and I was covering her patients .
before she left , she came to the den and told me about each and every patient under her care .
the next morning , I had no problem remembering that Mr. S. with chronic anemia had to be transfused cautiously : there was no checklist or electronic alert , but there was a red circle around his name on the napkin that I 'd slipped into my back pocket .
on my last day as a house officer , I bade the bartender of the den farewell .
it wasn 't an objective professional assessment - he knew me only outside work .
the bartender had given me a 10 out of 10 for being human .
then the NHS was modernized .
junior doctors began working fewer hours , and their pay was raised .
they worked shifts and went home after their shift to the nice apartments they could now afford .
they communicated electronically rather than in person .
ward sisters no longer remembered their names , let alone their deeds .
they may have been less tired than we were , but they must have been even lonelier .
and when they were struggling , their melancholies must have gone unnoticed by their colleagues , as the den fell into disuse and was ultimately shut down .
in patients with type 2 diabetes , inhibitors of sodium @-@ glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) reduce the risk of a first hospitalization for heart failure , possibly through glucose @-@ independent mechanisms .
more data are needed regarding the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with established heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction , regardless of the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes .
in this phase 3 , placebo @-@ controlled trial , we randomly assigned 4744 patients with New York Heart Association class II , III , or IV heart failure and an ejection fraction of 40 % or less to receive either dapagliflozin ( at a dose of 10 mg once daily ) or placebo , in addition to recommended therapy .
the primary outcome was a composite of worsening heart failure ( hospitalization or an urgent visit resulting in intravenous therapy for heart failure ) or cardiovascular death .
over a median of 18.2 months , the primary outcome occurred in 386 of 2373 patients ( 16.3 % ) in the dapagliflozin group and in 502 of 2371 patients ( 21.2 % ) in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.74 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.65 to 0.85 ; P < 0.001 ) .
a first worsening heart failure event occurred in 237 patients ( 10.0 % ) in the dapagliflozin group and in 326 patients ( 13.7 % ) in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.70 ; 95 % CI , 0.59 to 0.83 ) .
death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 227 patients ( 9.6 % ) in the dapagliflozin group and in 273 patients ( 11.5 % ) in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.82 ; 95 % CI , 0.69 to 0.98 ) ; 276 patients ( 11.6 % ) and 329 patients ( 13.9 % ) , respectively , died from any cause ( hazard ratio , 0.83 ; 95 % CI , 0.71 to 0.97 ) .
findings in patients with diabetes were similar to those in patients without diabetes .
the frequency of adverse events related to volume depletion , renal dysfunction , and hypoglycemia did not differ between treatment groups .
among patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction , the risk of worsening heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes was lower among those who received dapagliflozin than among those who received placebo , regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes . ( Funded by AstraZeneca ; DAPA @-@ HF ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT03036124 . )
large clinical trials involving patients with type 2 diabetes have shown that inhibitors of sodium @-@ glucose cotransporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure.1 @-@ 4
most patients in these trials did not have heart failure at baseline , so the benefit of treatment with an SGLT2 inhibitor largely reflected the prevention of incident heart failure .
the reduction in the risk of hospitalization for heart failure was observed early after randomization , which raised the possibility of mechanisms of action that differed from those usually postulated to explain the cardiovascular benefits of glucose @-@ lowering therapies.5 @-@ 9
in addition to diuretic and related hemodynamic actions of SGLT2 inhibitors , effects on myocardial metabolism , ion transporters , fibrosis , adipokines , and vascular function have also been proposed.5 @-@ 9
these actions , along with preservation of renal function , would also benefit patients with established heart failure , including those without diabetes , in whom SGLT2 inhibitors have not been tested.4,10,11
we designed the DAPA @-@ HF ( Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure ) trial to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction , regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes.12,13
the executive committee designed and oversaw the conduct and analysis of the trial in collaboration with the sponsor , AstraZeneca.12,13
the trial was conducted and reported in accordance with the protocol and the statistical analysis plan , both of which are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org .
the trial was approved by the ethics committee at each center .
the safety of patients in the trial was overseen by an independent data and safety monitoring committee .
the analyses conducted by the sponsor were replicated by an independent academic group at the University of Glasgow .
the first draft of the manuscript was prepared by the first author , who had unrestricted access to the data , and was reviewed and edited by all the authors .
all the authors made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol .
eligibility requirements included an age of at least 18 years , an ejection fraction of 40 % or less , and New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class II , III , or IV symptoms .
patients were required to have a plasma level of N @-@ terminal pro @-@ B @-@ type natriuretic peptide ( NT @-@ proBNP ) of at least 600 pg per milliliter ( or ≥ 400 pg per milliliter if they had been hospitalized for heart failure within the previous 12 months ) .
patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter on baseline electrocardiography were required to have an NT @-@ proBNP level of at least 900 pg per milliliter , regardless of their history of hospitalization for heart failure .
patients were required to receive standard heart @-@ failure device therapy ( an implantable cardioverter @-@ defibrillator , cardiac resynchronization therapy , or both ) and standard drug therapy , including an angiotensin @-@ converting @-@ enzyme inhibitor , an angiotensin @-@ receptor blocker , or sacubitril @-@ valsartan plus a beta @-@ blocker , unless such use was contraindicated or resulted in unacceptable side effects .
in addition , the use of a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist was encouraged .
drug doses were individually tailored , in accordance with guideline recommendations .
patients with type 2 diabetes continued to take their glucose @-@ lowering therapies , but doses could be adjusted as required .
specifically , the dose of insulin and sulfonylurea could be reduced to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia ( e.g. , in patients with a glycated hemoglobin level of < 7 % ) .
exclusion criteria included recent treatment with or unacceptable side effects associated with an SGLT2 inhibitor , type 1 diabetes mellitus , symptoms of hypotension or a systolic blood pressure of less than 95 mm Hg , and an estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) below 30 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body @-@ surface area ( or rapidly declining renal function ) .
all the patients provided written informed consent and entered a 14 @-@ day screening period , during which the trial inclusion and exclusion criteria were checked and baseline information gathered .
after this screening , patients were randomly assigned to receive either dapagliflozin ( at a dose of 10 mg once daily ) or matching placebo , in accordance with the sequestered , fixed @-@ randomization schedule , with the use of balanced blocks to ensure an approximate 1 : 1 ratio of the two regimens .
investigators used an interactive voice- or Web @-@ response system to determine treatment assignment .
randomization was stratified on the basis of a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes ( i.e. , an established diagnosis or a glycated hemoglobin level of ≥ 6.5 % [ ≥ 48 mmol per mole ] ) confirmed at screening .
patients were evaluated at 14 days and 60 days after randomization , with a focus on assessment of heart failure and volume status , adverse events , and an evaluation of renal function and potassium levels .
the full schedule of assessments is provided in the trial protocol .
dapagliflozin or placebo was to be discontinued if pregnancy or diabetic ketoacidosis occurred .
dose reduction ( to 5 mg daily of dapagliflozin or placebo ) or temporary discontinuation was permitted in case of an acute , unexpected decline in the eGFR , volume depletion , or hypotension ( or to avoid these conditions ) , with a subsequent increase in dose or restarting of treatment , if possible .
the primary outcome was a composite of worsening heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes .
an episode of worsening heart failure was either an unplanned hospitalization or an urgent visit resulting in intravenous therapy for heart failure .
a key secondary outcome was a composite of hospitalization for heart failure or cardiovascular death .
the additional secondary outcomes were the total number of hospitalizations for heart failure ( including repeat admissions ) and cardiovascular deaths ; the change from baseline to 8 months in the total symptom score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire , which is scored on a scale from 0 to 100 , with a higher score indicating fewer symptoms and a change of 5 or more points considered to be clinically meaningful14 ; a composite of worsening renal function , which was defined as a sustained decline in the eGFR of 50 % or greater , end @-@ stage renal disease ( defined as a sustained [ ≥ 28 days ] eGFR of < 15 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 , sustained dialysis , or renal transplantation ) , or renal death ; and death from any cause.12
all outcomes were adjudicated by the members of a clinical @-@ events committee , who were unaware of trial @-@ group assignments , according to prespecified criteria ( with definitions listed in the Supplementary Appendix ) .15
the prespecified safety analyses included serious adverse events , adverse events associated with the discontinuation of a trial treatment , adverse events of interest ( i.e. , volume depletion , renal events , major hypoglycemic events , bone fractures , diabetic ketoacidosis , and amputations ) , a diagnosis of Fournier 's gangrene , and laboratory findings of note .
data on other adverse events were not routinely collected in view of the extensive previous collection of safety data regarding dapagliflozin.3
we calculated that 844 primary outcome events would provide the trial with a power of 90 % to detect a hazard ratio of 0.80 for the comparison between dapagliflozin and placebo , using a two @-@ sided alpha level of 0.05 .
with an expected annual event incidence of 11 % in the placebo group , we estimated that the enrollment of approximately 4500 patients would provide the required number of primary events , based on an anticipated recruitment period of 18 months and an average follow @-@ up period of approximately 24 months .
we used a closed testing procedure , with prespecified hierarchical testing of the primary and secondary outcomes .
the type I error was controlled at a two @-@ sided alpha level of 0.0499 for multiple comparisons across primary and secondary outcomes , with one interim efficacy analysis taken into account .
we included data from all the patients who had undergone randomization in the analyses of the primary and secondary outcomes , according to the intention @-@ to @-@ treat principle .
baseline characteristics were summarized as means and standard deviations , medians and interquartile ranges , or percentages .
we used a mixed model for repeated measurement to analyze longitudinal measures ( e.g. , glycated hemoglobin level and body weight ) and estimated the least @-@ squares mean differences between treatment groups , together with 95 % confidence intervals .
time @-@ to @-@ event data were evaluated with the use of Kaplan @-@ Meier estimates and Cox proportional @-@ hazards models , stratified according to diabetes status , with a history of hospitalization for heart failure and treatment @-@ group assignment as fixed @-@ effect factors ; for the renal outcome , the baseline eGFR was included instead of a history of hospitalization for heart failure .
we used the Cox models to calculate hazard ratios , 95 % confidence intervals , and two @-@ sided P values and used a semiparametric proportional @-@ rates model to calculate total ( including recurrent ) events.16
we analyzed the total symptom score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire as a composite , rank @-@ based outcome , incorporating patient vital status at 8 months along with a change in score from baseline to 8 months in surviving patients , using the rank analysis of covariance method , with a corresponding win ratio used to estimate the magnitude of treatment effect.17
we assessed the consistency of the treatment effect among 14 prespecified subgroups .
the safety analyses were performed in patients who had undergone randomization and received at least one dose of dapagliflozin or placebo .
we used Fisher 's exact test to compare the incidence of adverse events .
all the analyses were performed with the use of Stata software , version 15 ( StataCorp ) and R , version 3.5.1 ( R Foundation for Statistical Computing ) .
from February 15 , 2017 , through August 17 , 2018 , a total of 4744 patients were randomly assigned to receive either dapagliflozin or matching placebo at 410 centers in 20 countries ( Figure 1 ) .
the characteristics of the patients and the therapies for heart failure were well balanced between the trial groups at baseline ( Table 1 ) .
at screening , 42 % of the patients in each trial group had a history of type 2 diabetes , and an additional 3 % of the patients in each group received a new diagnosis of diabetes .
dapagliflozin was stopped for reasons other than death in 249 patients and placebo was stopped in 258 patients ( 10.5 % vs. 10.9 % , P = 0.71 ) .
at the last assessment , 2039 of the patients who were still taking dapagliflozin ( 98.1 % ) continued to receive the 10 @-@ mg daily dose ; 1993 patients ( 98.2 % ) were receiving the equivalent dose of placebo .
no patients in the dapagliflozin group and 2 patients in the placebo group had unknown vital status at the end of the trial ( Figure 1 ) .
the median duration of follow @-@ up was 18.2 months ( range , 0 to 27.8 ) .
the primary composite outcome of worsening heart failure ( hospitalization or an urgent visit resulting in intravenous therapy for heart failure ) or death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 386 patients ( 16.3 % ) in the dapagliflozin group and in 502 patients ( 21.2 % ) in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.74 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.65 to 0.85 ; P < 0.001 ) ( Table 2 and Figure 2A ) .
event rates for all three components of the composite outcome favored dapagliflozin ; the largest number of events of worsening heart failure were hospitalizations .
of the patients receiving dapagliflozin , 231 ( 9.7 % ) were hospitalized for heart failure , as compared with 318 patients ( 13.4 % ) receiving placebo ( hazard ratio , 0.70 ; 95 % CI , 0.59 to 0.83 ) ( Figure 2B ) .
death from cardiovascular causes occurred in 227 patients ( 9.6 % ) who received dapagliflozin and in 273 ( 11.5 % ) who received placebo ( hazard ratio , 0.82 ; 95 % CI , 0.69 to 0.98 ) ( Figure 2C ) .
during the trial period , the number of patients who would need to have been treated with dapagliflozin to prevent one primary event was 21 ( 95 % CI , 15 to 38 ) .
the incidence of the secondary composite outcome of hospitalization for heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes was lower in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group ( hazard ratio , 0.75 ; 95 % CI , 0.65 to 0.85 ; P < 0.001 ) ( Table 2 ) .
there were 567 total first and recurrent events ( 340 hospitalizations for heart failure and 227 deaths from cardiovascular causes in 382 patients ) in the dapagliflozin group and 742 total events ( 469 hospitalizations for heart failure and 273 deaths from cardiovascular causes in 495 patients ) in the placebo group , which resulted in a rate ratio of 0.75 ( 95 % CI , 0.65 to 0.88 ; P < 0.001 ) .
the increase in the total symptom score on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire ( indicating fewer symptoms ) was greater in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group between baseline and month 8 ( Table 2 ) .
more patients in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group had an increase of at least 5 points ( the minimally important difference ) in the total score ( 58.3 % vs. 50.9 % ; odds ratio , 1.15 ; 95 % CI , 1.08 to 1.23 ) and fewer had significant deterioration ( 25.3 % vs. 32.9 % ; odds ratio , 0.84 ; 95 % CI , 0.78 to 0.90 ; P < 0.001 for both comparisons ) .
the incidence of the prespecified renal composite outcome did not differ between the treatment groups ( Table 2 ) .
a total of 276 patients ( 11.6 % ) in the dapagliflozin group and 329 patients ( 13.9 % ) in the placebo group died from any cause ( hazard ratio , 0.83 ; 95 % CI , 0.71 to 0.97 ) ( Figure 2D ) .
details regarding the analysis of deaths and hospitalizations for heart failure are summarized in Figure S2 .
the effect of dapagliflozin on the primary outcome was generally consistent across prespecified subgroups , including in patients without diabetes at baseline , although the patients in NYHA functional class III or IV appeared to have less benefit than those in class II ( Figure 3 ) .
in a post hoc subgroup analysis involving patients taking sacubitril @-@ valsartan at baseline , the hazard ratio for the comparison of dapagliflozin and placebo for the primary outcome was 0.75 ( 95 % CI , 0.50 , 1.13 ) , as compared with 0.74 ( 95 % CI , 0.65 to 0.86 ) among those not taking sacubitril @-@ valsartan .
changes from baseline to 8 months in values for glycated hemoglobin , hematocrit , creatinine , NT @-@ proBNP , systolic blood pressure , and weight are shown in Table 2 .
a total of 8 patients ( 5 in the dapagliflozin group and 3 in the placebo group ) were excluded from the safety analyses because they did not receive dapagliflozin or placebo ( Table 2 ) .
serious adverse events related to volume depletion occurred in 29 patients ( 1.2 % ) in the dapagliflozin group and in 40 patients ( 1.7 % ) in the placebo group ( P = 0.23 ) .
serious renal adverse events occurred in 38 patients ( 1.6 % ) in the dapagliflozin group and in 65 patients ( 2.7 % ) in the placebo group ( P = 0.009 ) .
adverse events rarely led to a discontinuation of treatment .
all serious adverse events are listed in Table S1 ; there was no notable excess of any event in the dapagliflozin group .
in this randomized , placebo @-@ controlled trial involving patients with heart failure and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction , the risk of the primary composite outcome of worsening heart failure ( hospitalization or an urgent visit resulting in intravenous therapy for heart failure ) or death from cardiovascular causes was lower in the dapagliflozin group than in the placebo group .
each of the three components of the composite outcome was less common in the dapagliflozin group , as were the total numbers of hospitalizations for heart failure and deaths from cardiovascular causes .
the use of dapagliflozin also resulted in fewer symptoms of heart failure , as measured on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire .
the observed benefits , which were substantial and clinically significant , occurred early after randomization and were seen in patients who were receiving other recommended therapies for heart failure .
dapagliflozin was as effective in the 55 % of patients without type 2 diabetes as in those with diabetes .
this demonstration of the cardiovascular benefits of an SGLT2 inhibitor in patients without diabetes provides support for prior suggestions that such treatment has beneficial actions other than glucose lowering.4 @-@ 11
thus , our findings potentially extend the therapeutic role of dapagliflozin beyond patients with diabetes .
our population was distinct from the patients in previous trials of SGLT2 inhibitors , since our patients were at much higher risk for hospitalization for heart failure and for death from cardiovascular causes than many of the patients in the previous trials .
most of the patients in our trial were already being treated with a loop diuretic and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist , and we did not know whether dapagliflozin would cause the initial diuresis seen in other patient groups .
we did not know whether such an effect might lead to volume depletion and worsening of renal function , since many of our patients had chronic kidney disease .
as it turned out , neither of these adverse effects was common ( each occurring in < 8 % of the patients , with no between @-@ group difference ) , and serious renal adverse events were generally uncommon and significantly less frequent in the dapagliflozin group .
overall , few patients stopped dapagliflozin or placebo because of any adverse effect ( < 5 % of the patients in either treatment group ) .
major hypoglycemia was rare , as was diabetic ketoacidosis , and both of these adverse events occurred only in patients with diabetes .
we used specific inclusion and exclusion criteria , which may have limited the generalizability of our findings .
less than 5 % of the patients were black , and relatively few were very elderly with multiple coexisting illnesses .
the baseline use of sacubitril @-@ valsartan , which is more effective than renin @-@ angiotensin system blockade alone at reducing the incidence of hospitalization for heart failure and death from cardiovascular causes , was low.18
however , the postulated mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibition and neprilysin inhibition are distinct , and in a post hoc subgroup analysis , the benefit of dapagliflozin was similar in patients treated with sacubitril @-@ valsartan and in those who did not receive such treatment.19,20
among patients with heart failure and a reduced ejection fraction , those who received the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin had a lower risk of worsening heart failure or death from cardiovascular causes and better symptom scores than those who received placebo , regardless of the presence or absence of diabetes .
CDC 's interim guidance highlights that patients may present with both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms .
the CDC has updated its interim guidance for the evaluation and management of patients with suspected e @-@ cigarette , or vaping @-@ associated , lung injury ( EVALI ) , based on the 1299 cases reported as of October 8 .
the chemical ( s ) responsible for the lung injury have not yet been identified ( THC @-@ containing products appear to be strongly associated ) and no specific testing exists for a definitive diagnosis .
among the recommendations :
history : ask about vaping .
consider EVALI in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with respiratory , gastrointestinal , or constitutional symptoms who vape .
GI symptoms may precede respiratory symptoms .
physical exam : start with vital signs and pulse oximetry and a complete physical exam .
patients with EVALI may have unremarkable auscultatory findings .
laboratory testing : depending on history and presentation , consider testing for bacterial viral pathogens , endemic mycoses ( e.g. , histoplasmosis , coccidioidomycosis ) , and opportunistic infections .
test for signs of inflammation , including white blood cell count , serum inflammatory markers , and transaminases .
urine toxicology testing for THC is recommended .
imaging : consider chest x @-@ ray and chest computed tomography ( CT ) scan for patients with vaping history and GI or respiratory symptoms , especially if hypoxic ( O2 saturation < 95 % on room air ) .
an abnormal CT scan showing ground glass opacities despite a normal appearing chest x @-@ ray is possible .
admit patients with hypoxia or respiratory distress .
for those managed as outpatients , re @-@ evaluate at 24 to 48 hours .
consider initiation of corticosteroids .
start antibiotics and influenza antivirals if there are concerns for an infectious process .
consider consultation with a pulmonologist and baseline pulmonary function testing .
after discharge , close follow @-@ up is recommended .
consider repeating pulmonary function testing and chest x @-@ ray at 1 to 2 months .
advise patients to stop all e @-@ cigarette and vaping use .
considering EVALI in the differential diagnosis for patients with vaping history ( one has to ask ! ) and GI complaints ( hyperemesis , vomiting , nausea , abdominal pain ) or respiratory distress ( tightness , hypoxia ) is now standard of care .
although not mentioned in the CDC guidance , my pulmonary colleagues advise that patients with EVALI have responded well to albuterol and chest physical therapy in addition to corticosteroids .
prescribing a nicotine patch at discharge may help patients manage nicotine withdrawal symptoms .
both ablation types resulted in > 98 % reduction in AF burden in a study that used continuous monitoring in all patients .
in a Canadian RCT involving 346 patients with paroxysmal AF that failed treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs ( AADs ) , researchers examined three ablation strategies for pulmonary vein isolation : radiofrequency catheter with contact force , cryoablation with 4 @-@ minute freezes , and cryoablation with 2 @-@ minute freezes ( NCT01913522 ) .
all patients had ILRs implanted ≥ 30 days before ablation ( median , 74 days ) .
during the 3 @-@ month blanking period , AADs ( but not amiodarone ) were allowed .
acute success of complete pulmonary vein isolation was seen in all patients .
the primary endpoint , AF or atrial tachyarrhythmia > 30 seconds or repeat ablation , was similar in all groups at 1 year ( 46 % -48 % ) .
data from the ILRs showed decreases in median AF burden from 1.46 % to 3.71 % of the time preablation to 0.00 % to 0.01 % postablation .
the groups did not differ in freedom from symptomatic atrial arrhythmias ( 73 % -79 % ) or adverse events .
other RCTs have found similar time to recurrence of symptomatic atrial arrhythmias with ablation .
very few AF RCTs have included continuous monitoring for asymptomatic arrhythmias ( e.g. , CASTLE @-@ AF using cardiac implantable electronic devices ; NEJM JW Cardiol Apr 2018 and N Engl J Med 2018 ; 378 : 417 ) .
the remarkable decrease in time in AF might be even more important to patients than time to first recurrence .
still , with the low preablation density of AF , these patients truly had paroxysmal AF ; whether the magnitude of reduction would be similar with persistent AF remains unanswered .
an observational study shows no increase in brain hemorrhage with seizure at stroke onset .
in the original study that evaluated tissue plasminogen activator ( alteplase ) for acute ischemic stroke , patients were excluded if they had a seizure at stroke onset .
these authors conducted a review of patients with acute stroke who received thrombolytic treatment at nine centers in Europe .
they assessed whether SaO was associated with any difference in symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage ( sICH ) , 3 @-@ month mortality , and 3 @-@ month functional outcome .
among 10,074 patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis for ischemic stroke , SaO was identified in 1.5 % .
patients with SaO were more likely to be women ( 54 % vs. 45 % ) , to have had prior stroke ( 26 % vs. 17 % ) , and to have prior functional dependence ( 16 % vs. 8 % ) and had a higher median baseline NIH Stroke Scale score ( NIHSS ; 13 vs. 9 ) .
of those with SaO , seizures occurred in 76 % before hospital arrival , 12 % before alteplase administration , and 12 % during thrombolytic infusion .
after adjustment for confounding variables , those with versus without SaO had no difference in rates of sICH , 3 @-@ month mortality , and poor outcome by 3 months .
in 89 of 146 with SaO ( 61 % ) , the final diagnosis was stroke , and in 57 ( 39 % ) , it was a stroke mimic .
this report provides useful information from a large registry regarding the frequency of seizures at stroke onset .
it is reassuring that seizure at onset did not increase the rate of brain hemorrhage or poor functional outcome .
seizure at stroke onset should not be an exclusion criterion for alteplase administration .
if there is any doubt as to whether the diagnosis is stroke or seizure , arterial imaging with brain computed tomographic angiography can be helpful .
a new European guideline is similar to U.S. guidelines but utilizes a more @-@ restrictive definition of familial CRC risk .
sponsoring Organization : European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy ( ESGE )
because of the increased risk for cancer in patients with Lynch syndrome ( LS ) or familial colorectal cancer risk and their relatives , prompt recognition by clinicians is crucial to implement appropriate screening and management .
this new guideline provides recommendations on the endoscopic management of these groups of patients .
follow patients with LS in specialized units ( national registries , genetic counseling centers , or high @-@ risk cancer centers ) where adherence to surveillance recommendations and quality are monitored .
start colonoscopy surveillance in patients with LS at age 25 for MLH1 and MSH2 mutation carriers and at age 35 for MSH6 and PMS2 mutation carriers .
perform colonoscopy every 2 years in asymptomatic individuals with LS and within 3 months in cases of suboptimal bowel preparation or incomplete procedure .
do not perform routine gastric or small @-@ bowel surveillance in LS , but consider testing for Helicobacter pylori .
based on a definition of familial CRC risk as having two first @-@ degree relatives with CRC or at least one first @-@ degree relative with CRC before the age of 50 , start colonoscopy surveillance at age 40 and repeat every 5 years after normal results from a high @-@ quality examination .
if there are polyps , follow established postpolypectomy surveillance guidelines .
the arguably more compelling feature of this guideline is the more @-@ restrictive definition of familial CRC risk , which was informed by a separate systematic review and meta @-@ analysis that shows lower risk for CRC among first @-@ degree relatives than previously reported ( Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2019 ; Sep 13 [ e @-@ pub ] ) .
future U.S. guideline updates should take into account this updated literature review on familial CRC risk .
adding durvalumab to chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival .
the standard front @-@ line treatment for extensive @-@ stage , small @-@ cell lung cancer ( ES @-@ SCLC ) has changed to add the PD @-@ L1 inhibitor atezolizumab to platinum @-@ etoposide chemotherapy ( NEJM JW Oncol Hematol Dec 2018 and N Engl J Med 2018 ; 379 : 2220 ) .
now , investigators have reported planned interim results of an industry @-@ funded , international , randomized , controlled , open @-@ label , phase III trial ( CASPIAN ) that evaluated platinum @-@ etoposide chemotherapy with or without the PD @-@ L1 inhibitor durvalumab in 537 chemotherapy @-@ naive ES @-@ SCLC patients .
at a median follow @-@ up of 14.2 months , results were as follows :
overall survival ( the primary endpoint ) was significantly improved with durvalumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone ( median 13.0 vs. 10.3 months ; hazard ratio , 0.73 ; P = 0.0047 ) .
the objective response rate was higher with durvalumab ( 79 % vs. 70 % ) , as was the complete response rate ( 2 % vs. 1 % ) .
progression @-@ free survival was similar with durvalumab or chemotherapy alone ( median 5.1 and 5.4 months , respectively ) .
grade 3 or 4 toxicity rates were similar in both arms ( 62 % ) , as was mortality ( 5 % and 6 % ) .
the majority of immune @-@ related adverse events were grade 1 or 2 and were experienced by 20 % in the durvalumab arm and 3 % in the chemotherapy @-@ alone arm .
grade 3 or 4 immune @-@ related adverse events were experienced by 5 % in the durvalumab arm and < 1 % in the chemotherapy @-@ alone arm .
the treatment paradigm for ES @-@ SCLC has advanced to combine immunotherapy with chemotherapy in the front @-@ line setting .
the immunotherapy of choice for ES @-@ SCLC is a PD @-@ L1 inhibitor , and the current trial now confirms durvalumab as an alternative to atezolizumab .
the majority of immune @-@ related toxicity with durvalumab was low @-@ grade hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism .
however , there was one immune @-@ related death caused by hepatotoxicity in the durvalumab group , which underscores the need for close vigilance in patients receiving immunotherapies .
it is also important to note that only patients in the chemotherapy @-@ alone arm received prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ; 8 % ) and that there are few safety data on the use of PCI with immunotherapies in this setting .
therefore , it is not advisable at this time to give PCI to ES @-@ SCLC patients receiving immunotherapy maintenance .
overall survival was improved versus chemotherapy in non @-@ small @-@ cell lung cancer patients , independent of their PD @-@ L1 status or tumor mutational burden .
a prior report of the phase III trial CheckMate 227 trial ( NEJM JW Oncol Hematol Jul 2018 and N Engl J Med 2018 ; 378 : 2093 ) showed that chemotherapy @-@ naive patients with metastatic non @-@ small @-@ cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and a high tumor @-@ mutation burden achieved improved progression @-@ free survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy alone during a minimum of 11.2 months of follow @-@ up .
now , investigators have assessed overall survival ( OS ) of the 1739 patients in the trial during a minimum of 29.3 months of follow @-@ up .
median OS among the 1189 patients with PD @-@ L1 expression > 1 % ( the primary endpoint ) was improved with nivolumab plus ipilimumab versus chemotherapy ( 17.1 vs. 14.9 months ; P = 0.007 ) .
among the 550 patients with PD @-@ L1 expression < 1 % , median OS was also improved with nivolumab plus ipilimumab ( 17.2 vs. 12.2 months ) .
rates of grade 3 or 4 toxicity among all patients were similar with nivolumab plus ipilimumab or chemotherapy alone ( 32.8 % and 36 % , respectively ) .
in contrast to the findings of the prior study , tumor mutational burden was not predictive of the improved survival benefit .
these updated survival results from CheckMate 227 demonstrate that frontline nivolumab plus ipilimumab improved survival in patients with metastatic NSCLC compared with chemotherapy , independent of PD @-@ L1 status or tumor mutational burden .
it is hypothesized that the beneficial effect in patients with PD @-@ L1 expression < 1 % may be due to the addition of CTLA @-@ 4 inhibition harnessing more effective antitumor immune cells from the peripheral compartments .
it is likely that nivolumab plus ipilimumab will become an additional frontline treatment option for patients with metastatic NSCLC , especially those with contraindications or aversions to chemotherapy .
retrospective analyses suggest that pulmonary embolism is ruled out by a d @-@ dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter in patients with a low clinical pretest probability ( C @-@ PTP ) and by a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter in patients with a moderate C @-@ PTP .
we performed a prospective study in which pulmonary embolism was considered to be ruled out without further testing in outpatients with a low C @-@ PTP and a d @-@ dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter or with a moderate C @-@ PTP and a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter .
all other patients underwent chest imaging ( usually computed tomographic pulmonary angiography ) .
if pulmonary embolism was not diagnosed , patients did not receive anticoagulant therapy .
all patients were followed for 3 months to detect venous thromboembolism .
a total of 2017 patients were enrolled and evaluated , of whom 7.4 % had pulmonary embolism on initial diagnostic testing .
of the 1325 patients who had a low C @-@ PTP ( 1285 patients ) or moderate C @-@ PTP ( 40 patients ) and a negative d @-@ dimer test ( i.e. , < 1000 or < 500 ng per milliliter , respectively ) , none had venous thromboembolism during follow @-@ up ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.00 to 0.29 % ) .
these included 315 patients who had a low C @-@ PTP and a d @-@ dimer level of 500 to 999 ng per milliliter ( 95 % CI , 0.00 to 1.20 % ) .
of all 1863 patients who did not receive a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism initially and did not receive anticoagulant therapy , 1 patient ( 0.05 % ; 95 % CI , 0.01 to 0.30 ) had venous thromboembolism .
our diagnostic strategy resulted in the use of chest imaging in 34.3 % of patients , whereas a strategy in which pulmonary embolism is considered to be ruled out with a low C @-@ PTP and a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter would result in the use of chest imaging in 51.9 % ( difference , − 17.6 percentage points ; 95 % CI , − 19.2 to − 15.9 ) .
a combination of a low C @-@ PTP and a d @-@ dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter identified a group of patients at low risk for pulmonary embolism during follow @-@ up . ( Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and others ; PEGeD ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT02483442 . )
the primary goal of diagnostic testing for pulmonary embolism is to identify which patients should be treated with anticoagulant agents and which should not .
the patients who should be treated are those who have pulmonary embolism that has a substantial risk of recurrence or progression.1 @-@ 4
the remaining patients , who are not expected to benefit from treatment , include those who do not have pulmonary embolism and those who have pulmonary embolism that is very unlikely to progress .
chest imaging with computed tomographic ( CT ) pulmonary angiography is the usual method of diagnostic imaging for pulmonary embolism .
chest imaging has high negative and high positive predictive values for pulmonary embolism , and it often identifies alternative diagnoses .
it has the disadvantages of radiation exposure , contrast reactions , high cost , and the fact that it can be time @-@ consuming to complete .
our premise is that the use of chest imaging should be avoided when possible .
this is most often achieved by ruling out pulmonary embolism through a combination of clinical assessment and d @-@ dimer testing .
it is now well established that pulmonary embolism can be considered to be ruled out if patients have a low C @-@ PTP for pulmonary embolism and a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter.1 @-@ 3,5,8
this combination of findings , however , occurs in only approximately 30 % of outpatients .
there are two ways that it may be possible to increase the percentage of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism who can have pulmonary embolism ruled out with the use of C @-@ PTP assessment and d @-@ dimer testing : by increasing the d @-@ dimer threshold level used to define a negative test or by using d @-@ dimer testing to rule out pulmonary embolism in more than just patients with a low C @-@ PTP .
preliminary findings suggest that pulmonary embolism is ruled out by a d @-@ dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter in patients with a low C @-@ PTP and by a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter in patients with a moderate C @-@ PTP.1,9 @-@ 11
in the Pulmonary Embolism Graduated d @-@ Dimer ( PEGeD ) study , we tested the strategy of ruling out pulmonary embolism in outpatients with a low C @-@ PTP and a d @-@ dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter ( i.e. , twice the usual threshold used to rule out pulmonary embolism ) and in those with a moderate C @-@ PTP and a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter .
outpatients ( e.g. , in emergency departments or outpatient clinics ) or inpatients ( because only one inpatient was enrolled , we shall refer to the study population as outpatients ) with symptoms or signs suggestive of pulmonary embolism were potentially eligible to be included in this prospective management study .
patients were excluded if they were younger than 18 years of age , had received full @-@ dose anticoagulant therapy for 24 hours , had undergone major surgery in the past 21 days , had a d @-@ dimer level that was known before the C @-@ PTP was assessed , had undergone chest imaging contrary to the protocol ( i.e. , before the C @-@ PTP was documented , or despite having a d @-@ dimer level of < 1000 ng per milliliter for a low C @-@ PTP or < 500 ng per milliliter for a moderate C @-@ PTP ) , had undergone contrast @-@ enhanced CT of the chest for another reason , had an ongoing need for anticoagulant therapy , had a life expectancy of less than 3 months , or were pregnant or geographically inaccessible for follow @-@ up .
patients were enrolled prospectively at university @-@ based clinical centers in Canada .
the study was approved by the research ethics boards at the participating institutions , and all patients provided informed consent .
depending on the preference of the research ethics board at the clinical center , patients either provided written consent before diagnostic testing or provided written or verbal consent within days after having undergone diagnostic testing that was consistent with the study protocol .
the study was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research .
the funding body had no role in the collection , analysis , or interpretation of the data , the writing of the manuscript , or the decision to submit it for publication .
the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the adherence of the study to the protocol ( available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org ) .
patient ENROLLMENT AND CARE MANAGEMENT
at the time of enrollment , clinical centers registered patients with the use of a central Web @-@ based system , which ensured that data from all enrolled patients were analyzed .
physicians used the seven @-@ item Wells clinical prediction rule ( scores range from 0 to 12.5 , with higher scores indicating a higher probability of pulmonary embolism ) to categorize the patient 's C @-@ PTP as low ( Wells score , 0 to 4.0 ) , moderate ( 4.5 to 6.0 ) , or high ( ≥ 6.5 ) ( Table 1 ) .1,2,5,12,13
they had access to a hard copy of the Wells prediction rule but did not receive individual training in its completion .
patients with a low or moderate C @-@ PTP had d @-@ dimer measured with the locally available assay ( Table 1 ) .
we managed patients " care according to the PEGeD algorithm , which was as follows : patients with a low C @-@ PTP and a d @-@ dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter or with a moderate C @-@ PTP and a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter underwent no further diagnostic testing for pulmonary embolism and did not receive anticoagulant therapy ( Figure 1 ) .
all other patients , including all patients with a high C @-@ PTP , underwent chest imaging ( CT pulmonary angiography or , at the physician 's discretion , ventilation @-@ perfusion lung scanning ) .
if chest imaging showed pulmonary embolism , patients received anticoagulant therapy ; otherwise , patients did not receive anticoagulant therapy .
study outcomes were assessed at 90 days after initial diagnostic testing , either over the telephone or in the clinic .
in addition , at enrollment , study participants were instructed to urgently contact study personnel or to go to the emergency department if their initial symptoms did not improve or if new symptoms developed that were compatible with deep @-@ vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism .
during follow @-@ up , patients with symptoms that aroused suspicion for pulmonary embolism or deep @-@ vein thrombosis underwent appropriate diagnostic imaging ; d @-@ dimer testing was discouraged ( see the protocol ) .
the primary outcome was symptomatic , objectively verified venous thromboembolism , which included pulmonary embolism or deep @-@ vein thrombosis .
all outcome events were evaluated with the use of predefined criteria by a central adjudication committee whose members were unaware of the results of diagnostic testing at initial presentation and of whether patients had received anticoagulant therapy .
the sample size was driven by the requirement that the percentage of patients with venous thromboembolism be estimated with high precision in the combined patients with a low or moderate C @-@ PTP who have pulmonary embolism ruled out by d @-@ dimer testing ( expected to be 0.8 % ) .
with a one @-@ sided alpha level of 5 % , a sample of 1036 patients would give the study 90 % power to rule out a percentage with venous thromboembolism of 2.0 % and would yield an upper boundary of the 95 % confidence interval of 1.5 % .
assuming that this group is 52 % of the total study population and adding 1.5 % for possible losses to follow @-@ up , we estimated that a sample of 2000 was required .
outcome measures were summarized as point estimates , expressed as percentages , with 95 % confidence intervals calculated with the use of the exact binomial distribution ; confidence intervals for secondary outcomes were not adjusted for multiple comparisons .
the primary analysis examined the incidence of venous thromboembolism during the 90 @-@ day follow @-@ up period among the combined patients with a low or moderate C @-@ PTP with negative d @-@ dimer testing who did not receive anticoagulant therapy .
the secondary analyses included the percentage of patients with venous thromboembolism in predefined subgroups ( see the protocol ) , the number of bleeding events and deaths overall , and the percentage of patients who avoided undergoing chest imaging because they had a low C @-@ PTP and a d @-@ dimer level of 500 to 999 ng per milliliter or had a moderate C @-@ PTP and a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter .
the Agresti @-@ Min method was used to obtain 95 % confidence intervals for the paired difference in the percentage of patients who would undergo chest imaging and d @-@ dimer testing with the PEGeD strategy as compared with other diagnostic strategies.14
data analyses were performed by biostatisticians using SAS software , version 9.4 ( SAS Institute ) .
from December 2015 through May 2018 , a total of 3133 patients were assessed by the clinical centers as meeting the inclusion criteria ; of those , 941 met one or more exclusion criteria ( Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org ) and 136 did not provide consent , which resulted in the registration of 2056 patients .
shortly after registration and before any study outcomes were suspected , central data monitors identified that 39 of these patients did not meet major eligibility criteria , and they were not included in any analyses ( Table S2 ) .
therefore , data from 2017 patients ( predominantly from emergency departments ; only 1 was an inpatient ) were analyzed .
the mean age of the patients was 52 years , and 66.2 % were female ( Table 1 ) .
despite negative d @-@ dimer testing , 1 patient with a low C @-@ PTP ( ventilation @-@ perfusion lung scanning ) and 2 with a moderate C @-@ PTP ( CT pulmonary angiography ) underwent chest imaging after enrollment ; none had pulmonary embolism .
at initial diagnostic testing , 5 patients without pulmonary embolism received anticoagulant therapy and 2 patients with pulmonary embolism did not receive anticoagulant therapy ( Figure 1 and Table S3 ) .
during follow @-@ up , 19 patients without pulmonary embolism at initial diagnostic testing started anticoagulant therapy for reasons other than venous thromboembolism ( atrial fibrillation in 13 ) ( Table S4 ) .
a total of 13 patients ( 0.6 % ) did not complete 3 months of follow @-@ up ( Figure 1 ) .
of 1970 patients ( 97.7 % of the total population ) who had a low or moderate C @-@ PTP , 1325 ( 67.3 % ) had a negative d @-@ dimer test and did not receive anticoagulant therapy .
none of these patients ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.00 to 0.29 % ) had venous thromboembolism during follow @-@ up ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ) .
of 1863 patients ( 92.4 % of the total population ) who did not receive a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism at initial presentation and did not receive anticoagulant therapy , 1 patient ( 0.05 % ; 95 % CI , 0.01 to 0.30 ) , who had a low C @-@ PTP , a positive d @-@ dimer test ( 1200 ng per milliliter ) , and negative findings on CT pulmonary angiography , had venous thromboembolism during follow @-@ up ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ) .
of 1285 patients ( 63.7 % of the total population ) who had a low C @-@ PTP , a negative d @-@ dimer test ( i.e. , < 1000 ng per milliliter ) , and did not receive anticoagulant therapy , none ( 95 % CI , 0.00 to 0.30 % ) had venous thromboembolism during follow @-@ up ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ) .
of these 1285 patients with a low C @-@ PTP , 315 had a d @-@ dimer level of 500 to 999 ng per milliliter , and none had venous thromboembolism during follow @-@ up ( 95 % CI , 0.00 to 1.20 % ) .
of 40 patients ( 2.0 % of the total population ) who had a moderate C @-@ PTP , a negative d @-@ dimer test ( i.e. , < 500 ng per milliliter ) , and did not receive anticoagulant therapy , none ( 95 % CI , 0.00 to 8.76 % ) had venous thromboembolism during follow @-@ up ( Figure 1 and Table 2 ) .
there were 7 major bleeding episodes , 23 minor bleeding episodes , and 34 deaths during follow @-@ up ; no deaths were attributed by the central adjudication committee to pulmonary embolism . ( for details on secondary analyses , see Table S5 . )
imaging TO DETECT PULMONARY EMBOLISM AND USE OF D @-@ DIMER TESTING
the PEGeD diagnostic strategy resulted in the use of chest imaging in 34.3 % of patients , whereas the standard strategy in which pulmonary embolism is considered to be ruled out with a low C @-@ PTP and a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter would result in the use of chest imaging in 51.9 % ( difference , − 17.6 percentage points ; 95 % CI , − 19.2 to − 15.9 ) , corresponding to a relative difference of − 33.9 % ( Table 3 ) .
by extending d @-@ dimer testing to patients with a moderate C @-@ PTP , the PEGeD strategy resulted in the use of d @-@ dimer testing in 97.7 % of patients , whereas the standard strategy would result in the use of d @-@ dimer testing in 86.9 % .
comparisons of the PEGeD strategy with the age @-@ adjusted strategy and with the strategy used in the YEARS study15 are summarized in Table 3 .
when we considered pulmonary embolism to be ruled out if outpatients were assessed as having a low C @-@ PTP and had a d @-@ dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter or were assessed as having a moderate C @-@ PTP and had a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter and therefore withheld chest imaging and anticoagulant therapy on the basis of these findings , none of the 1325 patients had thromboembolic complications during follow @-@ up .
as compared with the use of d @-@ dimer testing to rule out pulmonary embolism only in patients with a low C @-@ PTP who have a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter , the PEGeD algorithm increased the percentage of patients who had pulmonary embolism ruled out by d @-@ dimer testing and , therefore , did not proceed to chest imaging from 48.1 % to 65.7 % .
this corresponds to a 33.9 % relative reduction in chest imaging .
most of this benefit was from the ruling out of pulmonary embolism with d @-@ dimer levels of 500 to 999 ng per milliliter in patients with a low C @-@ PTP , because only 10.8 % of patients had a moderate C @-@ PTP and only 18.3 % of these had a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter .
because most of the patients who had pulmonary embolism ruled out with the use of d @-@ dimer testing had a low C @-@ PTP , our study provides stronger evidence for ruling out pulmonary embolism with a d @-@ dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter and a low C @-@ PTP than for a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter and a moderate C @-@ PTP .
however , our results in patients with a moderate C @-@ PTP support the findings of other studies that suggest that a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter rules out pulmonary embolism in these patients.2,3
our findings are consistent with those of the YEARS management study , which showed a low incidence of venous thromboembolic complications among patients with suspected pulmonary embolism who had a d @-@ dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter and a low @-@ risk YEARS clinical @-@ assessment score ( none of the following : clinical signs of deep @-@ vein thrombosis ; hemoptysis ; or pulmonary embolism considered to be the most likely diagnosis ) or who had a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter and did not have a low @-@ risk score ( ≥ 1 of these criteria ) .15
our data suggest that the PEGeD strategy results in a modest reduction in the use of chest imaging as compared with the YEARS strategy ( difference , − 2.0 percentage points ; 95 % CI , − 2.8 to − 1.2 ) ( Table 3 ) .
our findings are also consistent with those of a management study from our own group that showed that a d @-@ dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter ruled out thrombosis in patients with a low C @-@ PTP for deep @-@ vein thrombosis.16
the age @-@ adjusted d @-@ dimer interpretation strategy considers pulmonary embolism to be ruled out with a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter in patients 50 years of age or younger and with a d @-@ dimer level ( in nanograms per milliliter ) that is less than 10 times the patient 's age in those older than 50 years of age , provided that patients have a low or moderate C @-@ PTP.2,3,17
our data also suggest that the PEGeD strategy results in a greater reduction in chest imaging as compared with the age @-@ adjusted strategy ( difference , − 8.6 percentage points ; 95 % CI , − 10.0 to − 7.2 ) ( Table 3 ) .
an additional disadvantage of the age @-@ adjusted algorithm is that , because it uses a higher d @-@ dimer threshold to rule out pulmonary embolism only in patients older than 50 years of age , it does not reduce the use of chest imaging in younger patients , a subgroup of patients who are at higher risk from radiation exposure and are less likely to have alternative diagnoses identified by chest imaging .
strengths of our study include the following : it was large enough to provide estimates with reasonable precision in the overall study population and in important subgroups ; standardized testing for venous thromboembolism was used during follow @-@ up , with central adjudication of outcomes ; very few patients were lost to follow @-@ up ; many clinical centers participated ; and a number of different d @-@ dimer assays were used , which increases the generalizability of our findings .
with regard to patients lost to follow @-@ up , assuming that the percentage with venous thromboembolism among those patients with a low C @-@ PTP and a negative d @-@ dimer test was the same as the prevalence of pulmonary embolism among all patients with a low C @-@ PTP and a positive d @-@ dimer test ( i.e. , 18.6 % ; a worst @-@ case scenario ) , we estimate that two of the nine patients ( Figure 1 ) may have had venous thromboembolism during follow @-@ up ( 0.15 % ; 95 % CI , 0.04 to 0.55 ) .
limitations of the study include that almost all patients who were enrolled were outpatients ( only 1 inpatient ) , so the findings may not apply to inpatients ; too few patients had a moderate C @-@ PTP and a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter to precisely identify the negative predictive value in this subgroup ; and it is possible that physician discretion influenced which patients were enrolled .
in relationship to the last point , the study did not capture the total number of patients who were assessed for pulmonary embolism in participating centers .
however , among 127 patients from two of the clinical centers who were excluded because chest imaging was performed when it was not indicated by the PEGeD diagnostic algorithm , a post hoc analysis showed only two pulmonary embolisms ( in 1.6 % of the patients ) , which suggests that selective enrollment did not substantially bias the study findings ( Table S1 ) .
additional evidence suggesting that selective enrollment was not prominent includes the observation that the percentage of enrolled patients who had pulmonary embolism on initial diagnostic testing was similar to that in other North American studies involving outpatients18,19 and that similar percentages of patients had low , moderate , and high C @-@ PTP and negative d @-@ dimer tests as in a recent observational study involving patients with suspected pulmonary embolism from two of the PEGeD clinical centers.19
this study used the Wells score to categorize each patient 's C @-@ PTP as low , moderate , or high ( Table 1 ) .1,2,5,12,13
therefore , it is uncertain whether the same approach to d @-@ dimer interpretation can be used if C @-@ PTP is assessed without using a clinical prediction rule or with a different prediction rule .
the Wells score achieved good discrimination in the current study , with a prevalence of pulmonary embolism of 5.0 % among patients with a low C @-@ PTP and of 19.7 % among those with a moderate C @-@ PTP .
as long as the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in low and moderate C @-@ PTP groups is similar to these values , we believe that the PEGeD algorithm should be valid when C @-@ PTP is assessed in other ways .
in general , the prevalence of pulmonary embolism among patients who undergo diagnostic testing is substantially higher in Europe than in North America.18
this difference is expected to result in a lower proportion of patients in Europe than in North America being classified as having a low C @-@ PTP and a higher proportion being classified as having a moderate C @-@ PTP .
if the prevalence of pulmonary embolism in the low and moderate C @-@ PTP categories was also higher in a high @-@ prevalence setting , the negative predictive value of the PEGeD algorithm could be lower .
our findings establish that the risk of considering pulmonary embolism to be ruled out in patients with a low C @-@ PTP who have a d @-@ dimer level of less than 1000 ng per milliliter is low .
our findings also suggest that considering pulmonary embolism to be ruled out in patients with a moderate C @-@ PTP who have a d @-@ dimer level of less than 500 ng per milliliter is appropriate ; these findings are consistent with those of previous studies .
use of the PEGeD algorithm substantially reduced the number of chest @-@ imaging studies performed in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism .
a cancer derives from a clone of somatic cells that has escaped from the built @-@ in constraints governing healthy cellular function , leading to uncontrolled proliferation , tissue invasion , immune evasion , and the reshaping of the local tissue microenvironment.1
many of these cellular properties arise from somatic mutations that accumulated in the cancer clone throughout life .
modern DNA sequencing methods have enabled complete genomic characterization of cancers on an unprecedented scale , leading initially to an improved understanding of cancer biology and , more recently , to clinical applications .
these include improvements in cancer diagnosis and prognosis , identification of new therapeutic targets , decision support for therapeutic choices , and applications in disease monitoring .
in this review , we explore what we have learned from systematic sequencing of cancer genomes .
we discuss the current and potential future clinical applications of genomesequencing and reflect on both the promise and challenges around large @-@ scale integration of genome sequencing into precision cancer medicine ( see video ) .
massively parallel DNA sequencing methods , also called " next @-@ generation sequencing , " enable the simultaneous analysis of millions of fragments of DNA .
a sample from a patient 's tumor can be sequenced alongside a sample of normal tissue , usually blood , from the same patient , allowing genetic variants to be identified and classified as either somatic mutations , found only in the tumor sample , or inherited ( germline ) polymorphisms , also present in the normal sample .
proof @-@ of @-@ principle studies showed the feasibility of identifying all somatic mutations acquired by the cancer clone.2 @-@ 4
these studies have now been followed by analyses of data from tens of thousands of patients , 5 generating wide @-@ ranging insights into cancer biology ( Figure 1 ) .
initial clinical implementation of massively parallel sequencing has typically involved so @-@ called targeted sequencing , selecting either for the approximately 300 to 600 genes known to cause cancer or for all protein @-@ coding genes , which account for approximately 1 % of the genome .
the main advantages of targeted sequencing are lower costs and deeper analysis of specific regions of the genome known to be most important for cancer biology .
however , as costs of sequencing further decrease , sequencing of the entire 3 billion base pairs of the genome will probably emerge as the standard , since this would make it possible to identify all types of mutation in all regions of the genome.6
biologic and Clinical Insights from Cancer Genomes
somatic MUTATIONS THAT DRIVE CANCER
among the thousands of somatic mutations acquired by a cancer cell , growing evidence suggests that only a handful actually instruct the cell to function as an autonomous clone - these we call driver mutations .
the remaining mutations are termed " passenger " mutations , acquired by the clone before the first driver mutations arose or during or after its subsequent transformation .
driver mutations can take many forms , including substitutions of one base of DNA for another , insertions or deletions of small numbers of DNA bases , gains or losses of large chromosomal regions or even whole chromosomes , and rearrangements that fuse one gene to another or juxtapose one gene with the regulatory apparatus of another .
even though the protein @-@ coding content of the human genome is only 1 % , the vast majority of driver mutations fall within this portion , with approximately 300 to 600 of the more than 20,000 protein @-@ coding genes being targets for driver mutations.7 @-@ 11
a few driver point mutations in non @-@ protein @-@ coding regions of the genome have been identified , 12 @-@ 16 but with less frequency than protein @-@ coding drivers.17,18
although we have an increasingly complete catalogue of cancer genes affected by driver point mutations , gene fusions , and simple chromosomal rearrangements , understanding how to interpret large @-@ scale complex chromosome rearrangements is more difficult .
such changes can affect multiple genes simultaneously , and it is likely that their oncogenicity arises from an aggregate excess of cancer @-@ promoting over cancer @-@ suppressing alterations.11,19
driver mutations tend to accumulate gradually over time , with a cancer often requiring decades to acquire the full complement of cooperating events .
because driver mutations are causative , drugs that target the function of resulting proteins can be therapeutic .
for example , imatinib targets the BCR @-@ ABL fusion protein in chronic myeloid leukemias.20
the development of imatinib was followed by the development of BRAF inhibitors for BRAF @-@ mutant melanoma , 21 EGFR inhibitors for non @-@ small @-@ cell lung cancers , 22,23 anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) inhibitors for lung cancers with ALK fusions , 24 and anti @-@ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) antibodies for HER2 @-@ amplified breast cancers.25
all these therapies can block the impetus of a cancer at its source .
mutational PROCESSES IN CANCER
somatic mutation can arise from both endogenous and exogenous mutational processes .
exogenous mutagens include chemicals ( e.g. , tobacco , aflatoxin B1 , and chemotherapeutic agents ) , ionizing radiation , and ultraviolet light , all of which damage DNA , generating mutations when damaged bases are incorrectly repaired or copied .
mutations can also arise from cell @-@ intrinsic processes , such as errors that occur during DNA replication , reactive oxygen species , impaired DNA repair , and the activity of viruses .
many of these cell @-@ intrinsic processes occur at a constant rate throughout life , leading to linear accumulation of mutations with increasing age.26,27
DNA damage arising from mutational processes often enriches in particular DNA sequences , creating distinctive signatures in the cancer genome.28,29
more than 30 such signatures have been identified - some understood , some mysterious.29
these mutational signatures can specify whether a lung cancer came from a tobacco smoker or nonsmoker , 30 whether a hepatocellular carcinoma arose through exposure to the carcinogen aflatoxin B1,31 how ultraviolet light has shaped a melanoma , 32 and whether mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 caused an ovarian cancer.33,34
beyond point mutations , there are also many signatures of large @-@ scale chromosomal abnormalities , again arising from a mix of external and endogenous processes.35 @-@ 40
clinically , mutational signatures can aid therapeutic decision making .
a deficiency in mismatch repair massively increases mutation rates , generating variants recognized by the immune system .
as a result , these tumors , which have characteristic mutational signatures , 29 can have impressive responses to immunotherapy.41
a deficiency in homologous recombination through loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2 causes cancer cells to become dependent on other DNA repair pathways , leading to distinctive mutational signatures33,34 and vulnerability to inhibition of those other repair pathways.42
poly ( adenosine diphosphate @-@ ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) inhibitors , which kill cells with DNA breaks , have activity in breast , ovarian , and pancreatic cancers among carriers of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.43 @-@ 45
mutational signatures of homologous recombination deficiency are seen in these tumor types beyond those with loss of BRCA1 or BRCA2,33,34,46 which suggests that other patients may also benefit from such therapy .
tumor HISTORY AND INTRATUMOR HETEROGENEITY
within individual tumors , substantial genomic diversity exists among the cells , resulting from ongoing mutational processes and Darwinian selection for fitter subclones of tumor cells .
clonal structures of tumors can be reconstructed with the use of genome sequencing.47 @-@ 51
some tumor types , such as clear @-@ cell renal cancer48,52 @-@ 54 and colorectal cancer , 55,56 acquire driver mutations in a particular order , whereas others , such as breast57,58 and lung59,60 cancers , show multiple routes of evolution .
metastasis , when it occurs , typically arises through dissemination late in the evolution of the primary tumor.49,53,61 @-@ 63
how to use information about the clonal diversity of a cancer in clinical practice remains uncertain .
different regions of a primary tumor - or , indeed , metastatic deposits - may harbor different driver mutations , which complicates therapeutic decision making.48,61
proof @-@ of @-@ principle studies have shown that tumors with higher subclonal diversity are associated with a worse prognosis , 54,59,64 and driver mutations can change the prognosis even when they represent a small proportion of tumor cells.65
an important application will be the prediction of the likelihood that a cancer harbors a drug @-@ resistant subclone ; such predictions would be facilitated by serial monitoring of tumors .
mutations conferring drug resistance often predate targeted therapy.66 @-@ 68
for example , minor clones in blood with TP53 driver mutations can expand after chemotherapy to seed therapy @-@ related leukemia.68
neoantigens IN CANCER
our immune system is actively engaged in surveillance to protect against tumor development .
somatic mutations within a cancer result in the generation of new peptides , termed neoantigens , that can be recognized as " nonself " by the immune system .
as might be expected , the neoantigen load is higher in tumors with a higher mutational burden , 69,70 and evidence is increasing that tumors with an elevated neoantigen load respond better to immunotherapy.41,69,71
improved characterization of neoantigens in cancer is shaping how we use immune @-@ checkpoint inhibitors and is refining other forms of immunotherapy , such as chimericantigen receptor T cells72 and cancer vaccines that explicitly target neoantigens.73
opportunities for Genome Sequencing over a Patient 's Lifetime
the causal role that mutation plays in cancer biology means that sequencing the genome offers opportunities to shape cancer therapy at multiple time points during a patient 's care pathway ( Figure 2 ) .
predicting FUTURE RISK OF CANCER FROM THE GERMLINE GENOME
the inherited ( germline ) genome can be interrogated at any stage of life , enabling prediction of a person 's risk of having a cancer in the future .
currently , screening for high @-@ penetrance inherited variants is undertaken in families with clusters of particular tumor types , with more than 100 high @-@ penetrance cancer @-@ predisposition genes known.74
many cause specific tumor syndromes , such as VHL mutations driving hemangioblastomas and renal cancers , 75 but many high @-@ penetrance germline variants increase the risk of a broader range of cancers than classically described.76
high @-@ penetrance pathogenic variants are found in 5 to 10 % of unselected patients with cancer , 76 but most inherited predisposition can be attributed to thousands of alleles commonly present within the population that individually provide only a slightly increased risk of cancer .
the best @-@ characterized cancers now have more than 100 genomic regions associated with risk , accounting for more than 15 to 20 % of familial relative risk.77,78
polygenic risk scores for a given cancer can be calculated by aggregating these many low @-@ penetrance variants , with persons in the top percentiles of risk nearing the relative risks associated with single high @-@ penetrance genes.78
the germline genome can also be used to identify patients at risk for toxic effects from chemotherapy because of variation in drug @-@ metabolizing enzymes.79
knowing that a patient has a high @-@ penetrance variant will typically trigger intensive screening programs , prophylactic surgery , or both - such strategies have improved outcomes in patients with Li @-@ Fraumeni syndrome or inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 , for example.80,81
the way in which polygenic risk scores should be incorporated into individualized cancer screening programs is less clear but will become increasingly important to determine as direct @-@ to @-@ consumer germline testing becomes widespread .
epidemiology AND PUBLIC HEALTH
that mutational signatures can act as a fingerprint for exogenous carcinogens82 heralds a new wave of " molecular epidemiology . "
incidence rates for many cancer types vary globally by orders of magnitude , although the cause of this variability is unclear .
genomes of tumors from high @-@ incidence and low @-@ incidence regions may reveal occupational or lifestyle exposures responsible for this variation .
this potential is exemplified by emerging data showing the effect of the mutagen aristolochic acid in regions with high incidences of renal tract and hepatic cancers .
the aristolochia plant , from which aristolochic acid derives , is used as an herbal medicine , especially in East Asia , and grows wild along the Danube basin , where it contaminates wheat harvests.83
most renal tumors in Romania84 and a large minority of liver and urinary tract cancers in East Asia85 @-@ 87 have thousands of mutations with a mutational signature exactly replicated by exposing cells to aristolochic acid in vitro.82
coupled with epidemiologic data , the case for aristolochic acid being a major causal agent of cancers in these regions is spurring public health initiatives to reduce exposure .
stratification FOR INTERVENTION AT PREMALIGNANT STAGES
many cancers pass through recognizable early stages of disease - the aim of screening programs is to identify and treat such cancers before they become incurable .
however , not all early @-@ stage lesions will shorten a patient 's life , so there is a risk of overtreatment .
genome sequencing of early cancer lesions may help stratify which lesions are likely to progress and which could be safely monitored without initial intervention .
for example , approximately half of high @-@ grade squamous dysplasias and carcinomas in situ of the bronchus progress to invasive carcinoma , but a third spontaneously regress .
those that progress carry a higher mutation burden , more copy @-@ number changes , and more driver mutations than those that regress , 88 which suggests that it may be possible to identify which lesions need early intervention .
similarly , approximately 10 to 20 % of healthy persons older than 70 years of age have clones in their blood that have the first driver mutations of a myeloid cancer89 @-@ 92 - integration of clinical , laboratory , and genomic features can suggest which of these patients are most likely to have progression to acute myeloid leukemia.93
large @-@ scale studies are under way to assess the predictive value of the genomic changes seen in other early neoplasms , such as Barrett 's esophagus , 94 intermediate @-@ risk prostate cancer , 95 and breast ductal carcinoma in situ.57
these proof @-@ of @-@ principle studies , although not yet ready for clinical implementation , presage an era of more personalized early intervention for cancer .
cancer DIAGNOSIS
certain somatic mutations are pathognomonicfor specific cancers , which suggests that they can be used for diagnostic purposes .
clinical testing for such mutations is best exemplified in hemato @-@ oncology , in which identification of mutations such as the JAK2 V617F mutation or a BCR @-@ ABL translocation in blood tests confirms an underlying myeloid neoplasm , 96 thus simplifying diagnostic pathways and often avoiding invasive biopsy .
for solid tumors , genome sequencing may facilitate interpretation of small presurgical biopsies , especially fine @-@ needle aspirations in which histologic analysis may be inconclusive .
for example , gene sequencing of thyroid nodule specimens obtained by fine @-@ needle aspiration can distinguish benign from malignant nodules.97
genome sequencing may also identify the tissue of origin and potential therapeutic targets in carcinomas of unknown primary site , 98 and algorithms that incorporate patterns of driver mutations and mutational signatures are increasingly accurate for this application.99
tumor CLASSIFICATION
classification systems strive to group cancers into categories , such that clear distinctions are defined between , and similarities are defined within , individual subgroups .
in current clinical practice , tumors are classified according to tissue of origin , histologic category , and stage - these classifications provide a universal language for describing both an individual patient 's cancer and cohorts in clinical trials .
as the catalogue of mutations driving common cancers reaches completion , 5 we anticipate that cancers will receive a categorization according to their genomic features , alongside their histologic type and tumor @-@ node @-@ metastasis stage .
driver mutations do not assort randomly among patients with a particular tumor type , with some pairs of cancer genes tending to be comutated in the same samples and others almost never mutated together in the same patient.100
as a result , a tumor type can be compartmentalized such that driver mutations are most concordant among patients within each subgroup and different among subgroups .
such schemes are well advanced in blood cancers , such as acute myeloid leukemia65 and myeloproliferative neoplasms , 101 but are also emerging in solid tumors , such as breast cancer , 102,103 medulloblastoma , 104 and pancreatic cancer.46
a genomic classification has the advantage that it groups tumors on the basis of disease @-@ causing driver mutations and is thus inherently linked to disease biology , ensuring long @-@ term stability and reproducibility of the classification .
patients with similar genomic features tend to have similar clinical features and therapeutic responses , evidenced by improved outcomes for PML @-@ RARA @-@ positive acute myeloid leukemia and HER2 @-@ positive breast cancer with therapies targeting their defining driver mutations.105,106
predicting PATIENT OUTCOME
given their causative role in disease biology and the considerable variability in distribution among patients , driver mutations contain much information about the future clinical course of a cancer .
much of this information is orthogonal to clinical variables , 65,101,103,107 and prognostic accuracy is therefore increased by combining clinical and genomic data .
the prognostic associations of individual genes tend to be specific to particular tumor types , such as SF3B1 mutations conferring a good prognosis in myelodysplasia108 but a poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.14
however , some general principles do emerge - for example , TP53 mutations typically worsen prognosis , genomic instability and extensive copy @-@ number variation are usually associated with more aggressive or treatment @-@ resistant tumors , and survival generally deteriorates with increasing numbers of driver mutations.14,64,65,101,102,109 @-@ 112
in current clinical practice , many treatment decisions are based on patients " predicted outcomes , whether that is judged according to stage , grade , or genetics : for example , decisions about whether to use adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer depending on stage , active surveillance or surgery for localized prostate cancer depending on Gleason score , and stem @-@ cell transplantation or intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia depending on whether high @-@ risk driver mutations are present .
estimating prognosis underpins these therapeutic choices because of the implicit calculation about whether the improvement in prognosis justifies the increased risks of toxic effects from more intensive treatment .
genome sequencing facilitates prognostic estimates that are personally tailored to the individual patient .
such estimates will depend on building " knowledge banks " comprising individual patient data from large cohorts and encompassing molecular profiling , clinical variables , histologic analysis , and staging , coupled with treatment and outcome data.65,93,101,103,107
beyond a one @-@ dimensional prediction of survival probability , such personally tailored predictions can assign probabilities to different clinical journeys , such as distant relapse , locoregional relapse , or disease @-@ free survival in patients with breast cancer103 and leukemic transformation or long @-@ term survival in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.101
such information is particularly useful in decisions about treatment intensity - allogeneic stem @-@ cell transplantation in acute myeloid leukemia , for example , can be offered more cost @-@ efficiently to those most likely to benefit if genomics @-@ based precision prognoses are used.107
precision CANCER TREATMENT
the identification of specific genetic alterations in tumors has helped develop and guide therapy .
tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting the BCR @-@ ABL1 fusion protein dramatically improve survival in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.20
vemurafenib , an inhibitor of BRAF , frequently mutated in melanoma , has shown impressive responses in patients with metastatic melanoma , 21 although the responses are often transient owing to the emergence of resistant subclones .
resistance is a theme that emerges repeatedly in the field of targeted therapeutics and is mediated by a range of mechanisms , including mutations that abrogate binding of the small @-@ molecule inhibitor , 113 acquired mutations in the same signaling pathway that bypass the drugged protein , 114,115 mutations that activate alternative proliferative signaling pathways , 116 and maintenance of a population of quiescent cells with epigenetically determined drug tolerance.117
knowing the likely mechanisms of resistance can enable preemptive therapy , evidenced by more durable responses of metastatic melanoma to combination therapy with BRAF inhibitors and inhibitors of MEK1 and MEK2.118
despite the promise of targeted therapies , most cancer genomes do not have driver mutations for which a molecularly targeted agent is licensed.10
attacking such tumors relies on finding their specific vulnerabilities : high @-@ throughput in vitro screens of drug libraries and genome editing are revealing unsuspected dependencies of cancers on particular genes that could be exploited therapeutically.121 @-@ 123
new approaches in clinical @-@ trial design - such as basket and umbrella studies , in which patients are directed to different therapies by virtue of the driver mutations of their cancers - have shown some occasional successes but overall have been disappointing.124
however , thus far , such studies have involved relatively small cohorts , 125 @-@ 128 and the clinical usefulness of genome @-@ guided therapeutic choices remains unproven beyond specific indications such as those described above .
cancer MONITORING
of course , hematopoietic tumors can be detected directly in blood .
in addition , many solid tumors shed fragments of their genome into the bloodstream , 129,130 as so @-@ called circulating tumor DNA .
this shedding is roughly proportional to tumor bulk , allowing both detection and quantification of tumor @-@ specific mutations in plasma samples .
methods for quantifying known point mutations131 @-@ 133 and genomic rearrangements134,135 present in the cancer enable early detection of relapsing clones , often months before clinical detection .
direct sequencing of plasma DNA may also identify clonal evolution and the emergence of resistance mutations while tumors are still in a state of minimal residual disease.66,67
monitoring of tumor @-@ specific genomic rearrangements is a cornerstone of precision therapy for hematologic cancers , enabling early intensification of therapy in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia that responds poorly to treatment136 or the switching of therapy for rising BCR @-@ ABL levels in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.137
clinical trials have established the appropriate treatment paradigms with this molecular monitoring , and analogous trials will clarify the role of plasma DNA monitoring in the care of patients with solid tumors .
personalization of Cancer Care Pathways
currently , patient access to modern genomics is patchy across regions and countries , but as protocols for sample processing and data analysis become established , access will broaden .
the debate about testing of gene panels as compared with whole @-@ genome sequencing is transient and distracting - ultimately , there is little doubt that we will be sequencing whole genomes , and we should be building the logistic infrastructure to handle this in our health systems .
this would have the added benefit of replacing many stand @-@ alone tests used across cancer diagnostics that are separately developed , maintained , and standardized .
Imagining this empyrean of genomics in clinical oncology , we have mocked up a future diagnostic report of the genome from one of our patients with a myeloproliferative neoplasm ( Figure 3 ) .
such reports will probably have an overall summary page with high @-@ level interpretative content , linking out to supporting data and evidence .
maximizing the usefulness of these reports will require much supporting infrastructure , including the following :
comprehensive quality @-@ assurance and quality @-@ improvement programs .
sequencing , analyzing , and interpreting cancer genomes is hard , and there is considerable variability in outputs among current providers - variability that can be ameliorated with national quality @-@ assessment programs.138
phase 4 clinical trials .
pivotal , phase 3 randomized trials are not powered to detect gene @-@ specific benefits of experimental therapeutics , and we should develop systems for collecting detailed genomic and clinical @-@ outcome data from patients receiving drugs after licensing .
frameworks for building and maintaining knowledge banks .
the collection , aggregation , and sharing of data will require national or international initiatives to amass patient data from clinical care and innovation in data storage and access .
development , testing , and continuous improvement of decision @-@ support algorithms .
physicians intuitively integrate performance status , prognosis , and therapeutic options for a given patient , a process that could be supported by accurate , up @-@ to @-@ date predictions from knowledge banks containing data from similar patients .
an ethical framework for the sharing and protection of genomic data .
engagement with the public and patients will be required to ensure that data management occurs in a transparent and responsible manner that protects patients " identity and respects individual wishes for privacy .
these programs have begun the process of transitioning cancer genomics from academia to a sustainable , routine , and , with time , universally accessible diagnostic test underpinning cancer care .
extremely dense breast tissue is a risk factor for breast cancer and limits the detection of cancer with mammography .
data are needed on the use of supplemental magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to improve early detection and reduce interval breast cancers in such patients .
in this multicenter , randomized , controlled trial in the Netherlands , we assigned 40,373 women between the ages of 50 and 75 years with extremely dense breast tissue and normal results on screening mammography to a group that was invited to undergo supplemental MRI or to a group that received mammography screening only .
the groups were assigned in a 1 : 4 ratio , with 8061 in the MRI @-@ invitation group and 32,312 in the mammography @-@ only group .
the primary outcome was the between @-@ group difference in the incidence of interval cancers during a 2 @-@ year screening period .
the interval @-@ cancer rate was 2.5 per 1000 screenings in the MRI @-@ invitation group and 5.0 per 1000 screenings in the mammography @-@ only group , for a difference of 2.5 per 1000 screenings ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 1.0 to 3.7 ; P < 0.001 ) .
of the women who were invited to undergo MRI , 59 % accepted the invitation .
of the 20 interval cancers that were diagnosed in the MRI @-@ invitation group , 4 were diagnosed in the women who actually underwent MRI ( 0.8 per 1000 screenings ) and 16 in those who did not accept the invitation ( 4.9 per 1000 screenings ) .
the MRI cancer @-@ detection rate among the women who actually underwent MRI screening was 16.5 per 1000 screenings ( 95 % CI , 13.3 to 20.5 ) .
the positive predictive value was 17.4 % ( 95 % CI , 14.2 to 21.2 ) for recall for additional testing and 26.3 % ( 95 % CI , 21.7 to 31.6 ) for biopsy .
the false positive rate was 79.8 per 1000 screenings .
among the women who underwent MRI , 0.1 % had either an adverse event or a serious adverse event during or immediately after the screening .
the use of supplemental MRI screening in women with extremely dense breast tissue and normal results on mammography resulted in the diagnosis of significantly fewer interval cancers than mammography alone during a 2 @-@ year screening period . ( Funded by the University Medical Center Utrecht and others ; DENSE ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT01315015 . )
women with extremely dense breast tissue have an increased risk of breast cancer , and their cancers are also less likely to be detected on mammography.1 @-@ 3
such patients may benefit from a tailored breast @-@ screening strategy , supplemented with more sensitive imaging methods .
the benefit of supplemental imaging is the subject of a worldwide debate .
in the United States , a federal law directs breast @-@ density reporting , 4 but supplemental screening is not recommended in American guidelines.5
although supplemental imaging increases the rate of cancer detection in women with dense breasts , 6 the question remains whether it improves health outcomes .
the first indication for a reduction in morbidity and mortality is a reduction in the incidence of interval cancers , since such a reduction may mean that cancers that would otherwise have become symptomatic would now be detected earlier.7,8
the Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening ( DENSE ) trial is a randomized , controlled trial to study the effect of supplemental magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) on the incidence of interval cancers in women with extremely dense breast tissue .
here , we present the primary outcome of the first 2 @-@ year screening round of the DENSE trial .
the trial design has been described in detail previously.9
in the multicenter DENSE trial , we enrolled women who were participating in the Dutch population @-@ based digital mammography screening program , which is conducted every 2 years for women between the ages of 50 and 75 years.10,11
from December 2011 through November 2015 , we enrolled screening participants who had negative results on mammography and who had extremely dense breast tissue , which was defined as grade 4 density as measured on Volpara imaging software , version 1.5 ( Volpara Health Technologies ) .12
Volpara density grades range from 1 to 4 ( classified as " a " to " d " in the latest version ) and correspond to the four @-@ point breast @-@ density categories of the Breast Imaging , Reporting , and Data System ( BI @-@ RADS ) of the American College of Radiology , which range from almost entirely fatty tissue to extremely dense tissue . ( details regarding the grading system are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. ) 12,13
we randomly assigned the women in a 1 : 4 ratio to a group that was invited to undergo supplemental MRI or to a group that received mammography screening only .
the women underwent central randomization with the use of a computer @-@ based program in varying block sizes , stratified according to hospital ( among the eight participating centers ) and regional screening organization ( among the four participating regions ) .
after randomization , only the women who had been assigned to the MRI @-@ invitation group were informed about the group assignment and were asked to participate in the trial .
this process was performed according to the Zelen design14 of randomization before informed consent was obtained .
this design was used to prevent anxiety in the control group and to reduce the probability that women in the control group would arrange for MRI examination on their own initiative .
for all women who had undergone randomization , data were gathered regarding breast density , age , socioeconomic status , and urbanization level.15,16
the participants who underwent MRI screening received a travel allowance of € 20 ( $ 20.24 U.S. ) .
the MRI examination was financed with grant money .
on November 11 , 2011 , the trial was approved by the Dutch Minister of Health , Welfare , and Sport , under advisement from the Health Council of the Netherlands .
the trial was financially supported by the University Medical Center Utrecht , the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development , the Dutch Cancer Society , the Dutch Pink Ribbon @-@ A Sister 's Hope organization , Stichting Kankerpreventie Midden @-@ West , and Bayer Pharmaceuticals , with an in @-@ kind contribution from Volpara Health Technologies .
the authors designed the trial , gathered and analyzed the data , and wrote the manuscript .
with the exception of the University Medical Center Utrecht , none of the funders had any role in these tasks .
all the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and analysis and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol ( available at NEJM.org ) .
all the trial participants had a negative result on regular mammographic screening ( bilateral craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views ) .
a negative result was defined as a BI @-@ RADS radiographic score of 1 or 2 on a 6 @-@ point scale on which a higher score reflects a greater cancer risk .
a BI @-@ RADS score of 6 ( which indicates known biopsy @-@ confirmed cancer ) was not used for evaluation in this screening trial.13,17
all MRI examinations were performed on 3.0 Tesla systems with the use of a dedicated bilateral breast coil . ( a link to an interactive mobile app with additional data about the trial is provided in the Supplementary Appendix . )
single @-@ read MRI examinations were performed according to the BI @-@ RADS MRI lexicon18 and were conducted by breast radiologists whose experience ranged from 5 to 23 years .
all the participants who had a BI @-@ RADS score of 4 or 5 were recalled for additional workup .
in participants with a BI @-@ RADS score of 3 , double reading of the MRI was performed , and if there was consensus on a score of 3 , follow @-@ up imaging with MRI after 6 months was planned .
the results of the follow @-@ up MRI had to be reported as either negative ( BI @-@ RADS score of 1 or 2 , with a return to the regular screening program ) or positive ( BI @-@ RADS score of 4 or 5 , with recall ) .
women in the mammography @-@ only group received the standard of care , which consisted of the regular screening program with invitations to undergo mammography every 2 years .
the primary outcome was the between @-@ group difference in the incidence of interval cancers .
we collected data regarding the number of interval cancers and the tumor characteristics in the two groups through linkage with the Netherlands Cancer Registry .
in the MRI @-@ invitation group , cancers were detected either on the screening MRI or at the 6 @-@ month repeat screening , if applicable .
interval cancers included all the breast cancers that were diagnosed after negative results on mammography before the next scheduled mammography examination .
if no mammography was scheduled ( e.g. , because of an age of > 75 years ) , an interval cancer was defined as one diagnosed within 24 months after the negative results on mammography .
this definition presumes that the interval cancer would have been detected on subsequent mammography .
key secondary outcomes included the recall rate for additional examination , the cancer @-@ detection rate on MRI , the false positive rate , the positive predictive value , and tumor characteristics .
the recall rate was defined as the percentage of participants who had a positive result on MRI screening among all the women who had undergone MRI screening .
a BI @-@ RADS score of 3 , 4 , or 5 was considered to be a positive result on MRI .
for women who had more than one lesion , recall was based on the lesion with the highest BI @-@ RADS score .
the cancer @-@ detection rate on MRI was defined as the percentage of women with a positive result on MRI screening that resulted in histologically confirmed breast cancer among all the women who had undergone MRI screening .
the false positive rate was defined as the percentage of women who had a positive result on screening MRI but who were later found not to have breast cancer .
in calculating the positive predictive value of recall after positive results on MRI , three measures were used .
the first measure ( PPV1 ) was the percentage of women with cancers detected on MRI screening among all the participants who had positive results on MRI .
for the second measure ( PPV2 ) , the denominator consisted of all the women who had an indication for biopsy ( BI @-@ RADS score of 4 or 5 ) .
for the third measure ( PPV3 ) , the denominator consisted of all the women who had undergone biopsy.13,17
the program sensitivity among the women who were screened with MRI is the number of women with cancers detected on MRI screening among all the women with screening @-@ detected or interval cancers .
descriptions were provided regarding the tumor @-@ node @-@ metastasis ( TNM ) stage , grade , morphology , and receptor status .
in women with more than one tumor , we described the one with the highest TNM stage .
adverse events and serious adverse events were recorded in the trial center during or immediately after the MRI examination or reported by the women within 30 days .
the trial was designed to have power of 80 % to detect a between @-@ group difference in the interval @-@ cancer rate of 1.95 per 1000 screenings in the intention @-@ to @-@ screen population.9
interval @-@ cancer rates were calculated as the number of interval cancers per 1000 screenings and per 1000 person @-@ years of follow @-@ up .
follow @-@ up was calculated as the time from a negative result on mammography until a diagnosis of breast cancer , emigration , loss to follow @-@ up , or death or until the next screening mammography took place or was scheduled to take place according to invitation , whichever occurred first .
if the women were no longer invited to participate in the screening program because of age , a fixed follow @-@ up of 24 months was adopted .
compiler average causal effect ( CACE ) analysis19 was applied to estimate the effect of actually undergoing supplemental MRI screening in the subpopulation of women who said that they would have accepted MRI screening if it had been offered .
CACE analysis was performed with the use of an instrumental @-@ variables method in which the instrumental variable was the randomization to MRI invitation.20 @-@ 22
for this analysis , the interval @-@ cancer rate among the MRI participants ( i.e. , those who actually underwent MRI examination ) was compared with the rate among women who would have accepted MRI screening if it had been offered in the mammography @-@ only group .
we calculated 95 % confidence intervals for differences in interval @-@ cancer rates using a bootstrap @-@ resampling method . ( details , formulas , and assumptions are provided in Fig .
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix . ) The type I error rate ( alpha ) was set at 0.05 .
all the analyses were performed with the use of RStudio software , version 1.0.143 .
characteristics OF TRIAL POPULATION
of the 40,373 women who underwent mammography screening , 8061 were assigned to a group that was invited to undergo MRI and 32,312 were assigned to a group that received mammography only .
details regarding participation have been reported previously.16
the MRI @-@ invitation group and the mammography @-@ only group were well balanced with respect to baseline characteristics ( Table 1 ) .
in the MRI @-@ invitation group , an interval cancer was diagnosed in 20 women ( 4 among the MRI screening participants and 16 among the nonparticipants who were invited but did not undergo screening ) of 8061 .
in the intention @-@ to @-@ screen analysis , the interval @-@ cancer rate was lower by 2.5 per 1000 screenings ( 95 % CI , 1.0 to 3.7 ) in the MRI @-@ invitation group than in the mammography @-@ only group ( P < 0.001 ) .
in an analysis based on person @-@ years , the interval @-@ cancer rate was lower by 1.3 per 1000 person @-@ years ( 95 % CI , 0.6 to 1.9 ) in the MRI @-@ invitation group .
the exclusion of women in whom ductal carcinoma in situ ( DCIS ) was diagnosed did not change this result .
Table S1 shows the incidence of cancers over time and includes a sensitivity analysis of different follow @-@ up times since the receipt of negative results on MRI .
using CACE analysis , we estimated that supplemental MRI screening among the subgroup of women who would have accepted MRI screening if it had been offered was associated with an interval @-@ cancer rate that was lower by 4.2 per 1000 screenings ( 95 % CI , 2.0 to 6.4 ) than that associated with mammography alone ( P < 0.001 ) ( Fig .
among the 4783 MRI participants , the recall rate was 94.9 per 1000 screenings ( 95 % CI , 86.9 to 103.6 ) , and the cancer @-@ detection rate with MRI was 16.5 per 1000 screenings ( 95 % CI , 13.3 to 20.5 ) ( Table 3 ) .
the positive predictive value of a positive MRI result ( PPV1 ) was 17.4 % ( 95 % CI , 14.2 to 21.2 ) , the positive predictive value of an indication for biopsy ( PPV2 ) was 23.9 % ( 95 % CI , 19.6 to 28.8 ) , and the positive predictive value of a biopsy ( PPV3 ) was 26.3 % ( 95 % CI , 21.7 to 31.6 ) .
the false positive rate was 79.8 per 1000 screenings ( 95 % CI , 72.4 to 87.9 ) ( specificity , 92 % ) .
as a result of the MRI screening , 300 women underwent a breast biopsy ; of these women , breast cancer was diagnosed in 79 ( 64 with invasive breast cancer and 15 with DCIS ) .
the program sensitivity of MRI screening was 95.2 % ( 95 % CI , 88.1 to 98.7 ) .
Table 4 shows the characteristics of all the cancers detected on MRI screening and interval tumors .
the screening @-@ detected tumors were smaller on average than those in the other groups .
the median size of invasive tumors was 9.5 mm ( interquartile range , 6.8 to 12.0 ) among MRI participants with screening @-@ detected tumors , 13.0 mm ( interquartile range , 10.5 to 17.0 ) among MRI participants with interval cancers , 15.0 mm ( interquartile range , 12.0 to 31.0 ) among MRI nonparticipants , and 17.0 mm ( interquartile range , 12.0 to 23.0 ) among women in the mammography @-@ only group .
among the MRI participants , the absolute incidence of invasive ( ductal and lobular ) cancers was higher than that in the mammography @-@ only group , as was the absolute incidence of DCIS and tubular cancers ; the latter may have an indolent disease course .
the absolute incidence of node @-@ negative and early @-@ stage cancers was also higher among MRI participants .
this finding was accompanied by a slightly lower rate of late @-@ stage cancers , but the number of such cancers that were detected was small , and a decrease in the number of late @-@ stage cancers was not expected until after several years of follow @-@ up.23,24
cancers that were detected in the MRI @-@ invitation group appeared to be better differentiated and more often were hormone @-@ receptor positive than those in the mammography @-@ only group .
at the next mammography screening , the cancer @-@ detection rate was 2.0 per 1000 mammography screenings among the MRI participants , as compared with 7.1 per 1000 screenings among the MRI nonparticipants and 6.0 per 1000 screenings among the women in the mammography @-@ only group ; these findings indicate that MRI examination advanced the time of diagnosis ( Table S1 ) .
among the MRI participants , 0.1 % reported either an adverse event or a serious adverse event during or immediately after the MRI examination ( Table S2 ) .
these events were related to vasovagal responses , contrast reactions , or intravenous line infiltration .
in addition , Table S2 shows all adverse events and serious adverse events that were reported by the MRI participants on a 30 @-@ day questionnaire that surveyed all health problems , regardless of a connection to the MRI examination .
in the first round of MRI screening of women between the ages of 50 and 75 years with extremely dense breast tissue ( defined as Volpara grade 4 [ or d ] ) and negative results on mammography , we observed a significantly lower interval @-@ cancer rate than in the mammography @-@ only group ( 2.5 vs. 5.0 per 1000 screenings ) in the intention @-@ to @-@ screen analysis .
among the women who were invited to undergo MRI , 59 % actually underwent the procedure .
of the 20 interval cancers diagnosed in the MRI @-@ invitation group , 4 were diagnosed in the women who had undergone MRI and 16 in those who had not .
among the women who would have accepted MRI screening if it had been offered , the incidence of interval cancers after the use of supplemental MRI screening was estimated to be lower by 4.2 per 1000 screenings than the incidence after mammography alone on CACE analysis , which resulted in an interval @-@ cancer rate similar to that observed on mammography in women with very fatty breasts ( Volpara grade 1 [ or a ] ) .3
depending on the proportion of women who would accept MRI screening in clinical practice , the effect at the population level could be closer to the effect in either the intention @-@ to @-@ screen analysis or the CACE analysis .
undergoing supplemental MRI was associated with a cancer @-@ detection rate of 16.5 per 1000 screenings and resulted in a false positive rate of 8.0 % ( 79.8 per 1000 screenings ) .
of the women who underwent a breast biopsy on the basis of an MRI indication , 26.3 % had breast cancer and 73.7 % did not .
in J @-@ START ( Japan Strategic Anti @-@ cancer Randomized Trial ) , 25 in which investigators evaluated supplemental ultrasonographic breast screening among Japanese women between the ages of 40 and 49 years , 58 % of the participants had heterogeneously or extremely dense breasts ( similar to Volpara grade 3 or 4 [ c or d ] ) .
cancer @-@ detection rates were 3.3 per 1000 screenings for mammography alone and 5.0 per 1000 screenings for mammography plus ultrasonography .
the addition of ultrasonographic screening resulted in an interval @-@ cancer rate of 0.5 per 1000 screenings , as compared with 1.0 per 1000 screenings with mammography alone , and an increase in the false positive rate from 8.8 % to 12.6 % .
in the Japanese trial , the baseline interval @-@ cancer rates were much lower than those in our trial , which may be related to a lower risk of breast cancer in this population ; other factors include the 1 @-@ year interval between screenings and the lack of preselection of women with extremely dense breasts .
in several paired studies of MRI screening and mammography involving women with dense breast tissue , all the women underwent MRI , so investigators could not evaluate the effect of such screening on the interval @-@ cancer rate .
in a study involving 612 women between the ages of 25 and 91 years who had breast density similar to Volpara grade 3 or 4 ( c or d ) and at least one other risk factor for breast cancer , Berg et al.26 observed a cancer @-@ detection rate with MRI and mammography together that was higher by 18 per 1000 screenings than the rate with mammography alone ; this higher detection rate was accompanied by an increase of more than 20 % in the incidence of false positive results .
in a trial involving 478 Chinese women between the ages of 30 and 71 years who had dense breast tissue and normal results on mammography , Chen et al.27 observed a cancer @-@ detection rate of 33 per 1000 screenings with MRI , which was accompanied by a false positive rate of 5.2 % ( with only BI @-@ RADS scores of 4 or 5 considered to be positive ) .
the indication for the breast examination ( e.g. , screening or evaluation because of symptoms ) in this study is not entirely clear .
in a trial involving 2120 women between the ages of 40 and 70 years that included 60 % who had dense breast tissue ( and approximately 20 % with extremely dense breast tissue ) , Kuhl et al.28 found that a first round of MRI in participants with normal findings on mammography , ultrasonography , or both resulted in a cancer @-@ detection rate of 22.6 per 1000 screenings and was accompanied by a false positive rate of 9.7 % ( with a BI @-@ RADS score of 3 , 4 , or 5 considered to be a positive outcome ) .
in our trial , a cancer @-@ detection rate of 16.5 per 1000 screenings for the first round of MRI screening and a false positive rate of 8.0 % appear to be roughly in line with these findings .
a direct comparison of exact numbers is difficult because of differences in populations but also because of the limited sample size of most of the other studies , which creates wide confidence intervals around estimates .
the main strength of our trial is the randomized design , which allowed us to study the effect of MRI screening on the interval @-@ cancer rate as the primary outcome .
other strengths of our trial are its embedding in a population @-@ based screening program , the multicenter design with different centers using standardized MRI protocols from different vendors , the use of fully automated and volumetric measurements of mammographic density , and the completeness of the data collection .
the women were selected solely because they had extremely dense breast tissue and not because of other risk factors .
in the upcoming years , the two incident screening rounds will provide important information on the value of ongoing supplemental MRI screening as compared with a one @-@ time @-@ only supplemental screening .
in the prevalent screening round described here , we may have detected an increased number of slow @-@ growing cancers that were less aggressive and that had been present for a long time .
this hypothesis is also indicated by the relatively large number of well @-@ differentiated and hormone @-@ receptor @-@ positive cancers among the MRI participants .
it is unclear how many of the cancers detected in our trial were life @-@ threatening and what fraction , if any , represents overdiagnosis .
a limitation of our trial is that it is not large enough to look at the effect of MRI screening on breast cancer @-@ specific or overall mortality .
this outcome would require a much larger sample size and longer follow @-@ up .
the lower rate of interval cancers that we found among participants who underwent MRI is indicative of and prerequisite for an effect on mortality.7
after that , a reduction in the number of advanced cancers would also be required to show a mortality benefit , which would require several years of follow @-@ up.23,24
thus , we are now using our results in a simulation study to evaluate the reduction in mortality and the extent of overdiagnosis , together with the effects on costs and quality of life.29 @-@ 31
the recall rate of 94.9 per 1000 screenings on MRI is a concern for potential implementation of supplemental screening .
therefore , we are now evaluating methods for minimizing false positive outcomes ( e.g. , by computer @-@ aided diagnosis , radiomics , and deep @-@ learning methods ) .
the issue of reducing the costs of MRI screening will be addressed by validating the use of abbreviated MRI protocols28 in this population .
we found that supplemental screening with MRI in women with extremely dense breast tissue resulted in the diagnosis of significantly fewer interval cancers than the use of mammography alone .
the data from incident screening rounds and longer follow @-@ up are needed in combination with simulation studies to assess the effect on the rate of advanced cancers and , eventually , on mortality .
the FLT3 inhibitor was superior to salvage chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory disease .
patients with FMS @-@ like tyrosine kinase 3 gene ( FLT3 ) -mutated acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) have high rates of induction failure and poor outcomes following cytotoxic chemotherapy in the relapsed or refractory disease setting .
now , investigators have conducted an industry @-@ sponsored , multicenter , randomized , phase III trial to assess the potential benefit of gilteritinib - an inhibitor of FLT3 and of AXL , a tyrosine kinase implicated in FLT3 inhibitor resistance - in 371 patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3 @-@ mutated AML .
patients were assigned 2 : 1 to receive gilteritinib or salvage chemotherapy .
the primary endpoints were overall survival ( OS ) and complete remission rate ( CRR ) .
median OS was significantly improved with gilteritinib versus chemotherapy ( 9.3 vs. 5.6 months ) , as was CRR ( 34.0 % vs. 15.3 % ) ; survival at 1 year was also improved with gilteritinib ( 37.1 % v. 16.7 % ) .
gilteritinib was active in both FLT3 mutational subtypes , ITD and TKD .
serious adverse events were less common with gilteritinib .
the activity against both FLT3 mutation subtypes and the ability to inhibit AXL provide mechanistic insight and another tool for treating patients with poor @-@ risk AML .
total bone fractures were fewer than expected , with direct oral anticoagulants associated with lower risk than warfarin , in a large registry study .
whether vitamin K anticoagulation ( VKA ) is associated with elevated risks for osteoporosis and bone fractures is an unresolved question .
in a retrospective analysis of Danish national databases , investigators examined histories of patients with atrial fibrillation ( AF ) who were treated with anticoagulation for at least 180 days and had not previously used anti @-@ osteoporosis medications .
of 37,350 patients ( median age , 73 ) , 33 % were treated with VKA ; the remaining 67 % were treated with direct oral anticoagulants ( DOACs ) .
the 2 @-@ year fracture rates were surprising low in both groups .
still , DOACs were associated with a lower incidence of any fracture than VKA ( 3.1 % vs. 3.8 % ) , leading to a 15 % lower risk with DOACs .
the incidence of major fractures was also significantly lower with DOACs ( 2.3 % vs. 2.8 % ) .
in an older population on anticoagulation , total 2 @-@ year fracture rates were low , but DOACs were associated with fewer fractures .
this study does not prove causality as the authors may not have fully adjusted for some patient factors , which should temper our enthusiasm for the finding of the superiority of DOACs .
still , in my mind , these data support findings of randomized , controlled trials indicating that DOACs should be the drugs of choice for anticoagulation of AF patients .
follow @-@ up in this population was relatively short , considering that anticoagulation is expected to continue for a lifetime ; differences between the agents would likely be magnified over time .
the authors and an editorialist discuss the biologic rationale for greater risks for osteoporosis and fracture with VKA .
in a randomized , controlled trial , researchers compared treatment success with the following therapies for refractory heartburn : laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication ; omeprazole with baclofen , desipramine , or both ( active medical ) ; or omeprazole with placebo ( control medical ) .
the study population comprised patients from VA gastroenterology clinics .
all had persistent refractory heartburn after a 2 @-@ week trial of omeprazole 20 mg twice daily and showed abnormal acid exposure , a positive symptom association probability ( SAP ) , or both on ambulatory pH / impedance testing while on omeprazole .
among 366 enrolled , most were excluded , resulting in 78 undergoing randomization .
at 1 year , the primary symptom endpoint was met in a significantly higher percentage of surgery patients ( 67 % ) compared with the active medical group ( 28 % ) or the control medical group ( 12 % ) .
there are some important caveats to note in interpreting these results .
also , it is important to note that around half of pH studies showed normal acid contact time but a positive SAP on twice @-@ daily omeprazole , which is in contrast with expert consensus that documentation of pathologic acid reflux should be required prior to surgery ( J Am Coll Surg 2013 ; 217 : 586 ) .
it was also impossible to blind this study ; therefore , patients who had the surgery could have been biased toward symptom resolution .
finally , the medications used in the active treatment arm are not well proven in this patient population .
despite these weaknesses , this study supports results from others of surgery in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease confirmed by an evaluation protocol similar to one used in this study .
survivors who were cooled were more likely to have favorable neurological outcomes .
early studies of out @-@ of @-@ hospital arrest after a shockable rhythm ( i.e. , ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation ) demonstrated benefit for therapeutic temperature management ( TTM ) .
subsequent investigations have yielded mixed results , and meta @-@ analyses have demonstrated benefit , harm , or no effect of TTM .
the population for which we have the least guidance are those who have arrest with nonshockable rhythm ( i.e. , pulseless electrical activity [ PEA ] or asystole ) .
French investigators randomized 581 patients after resuscitation with nonshockable rhythm to either 24 hours of hypothermia ( active cooling to 33 ° C with gradual rewarming ) or 48 hours of normothermia ( maintenance of 36.5 @-@ 37.5 ° C ) .
three quarters of patients had out @-@ of @-@ hospital arrest ; two thirds were from noncardiac causes .
patients with > 10 @-@ minute delays in cardiopulmonary resuscitation were excluded .
a protocol for prognostication or guidance on withdrawal of life support was not specified .
more than 80 % of patients died during follow @-@ up , most commonly due to withdrawal of life support .
patients in the hypothermia group were more likely to have cerebral performance category scores of 1 ( good function ) or 2 ( moderate disability ) at 3 months ' follow @-@ up ( 10 % vs. 6 % ; P = 0.04 ) .
mortality and intensive care unit lengths of stay were similar between groups , as were adverse events .
this is the best examination to date of patients with asystole or PEA , and it shows a small benefit for TTM to 33 ° C for 24 hours .
the numbers for in @-@ hospital arrest are small ; although cooling patients who arrest out of hospital might make sense , the data are less convincing for hospitalized patients .
surgical resection is associated with substantial postoperative mortality and morbidity .
endoscopic polypectomy is feasible for the great majority of colorectal polyps .
however , rates of surgical colorectal resections for nonmalignant polyps have been increasing in the U.S. ( NEJM JW Gastroenterol Mar 2018 and Gastroenterology 2018 ; 154 : 1352 ) .
to better assess outcomes after surgical resection for nonmalignant colorectal polyps , investigators conducted a retrospective analysis involving over 262,000 patients in the National Inpatient Sample database who underwent the procedure between 2005 and 2014 .
overall in @-@ hospital mortality was 0.8 % and was higher with open versus laparoscopic resections ( 1.1 % vs. 0.4 % ) .
mortality increased progressively with age , from 0.2 % in patients 50 to 59 years of age to 2.5 % in patients ≥ 80 years of age .
in @-@ hospital adverse events occurred in 25.3 % of patients and were most frequently gastrointestinal .
while mortality rates remained stable over time , adverse events decreased after 2008 .
the factors significantly associated with mortality were open surgical technique , older age , black race , Medicaid insurance , and comorbidity burden .
the New England and mid @-@ Atlantic regions had the lowest rates of adverse events ( about 23 % ) .
the mean length of hospital stay was 6.3 days , and the mean cost of hospitalization was about $ 50,000 .
in @-@ hospital deaths and adverse events were associated with significant increases in length of stay and cost .
these findings are comparable with those from a recent meta @-@ analysis of outcomes associated with surgical resections for nonmalignant colon polyps ( Endoscopy 2019 ; 51 : 961 ) , and they provide further proof that , with rare exceptions , surgery should not be a primary treatment option in this setting .
endoscopic polypectomy methods such as endoscopic mucosal resection are efficacious , more cost @-@ effective , and associated with much lower adverse event rates than surgery ( Gastrointest Endosc 2019 Sep 25 ; [ e @-@ pub ] ) .
use of the rule derived in this large prospective cohort would have had minimal impact on hospitalizations or serious events missed .
Discerning which older patients are safe to send home from the emergency department ( ED ) after a syncopal event is difficult , and thus many are admitted .
to derive a decision instrument , researchers prospectively studied patients aged ≥ 60 years with syncope or near syncope from 11 U.S. academic centers .
the researchers prospectively recorded 13 potential predictor variables , including NT @-@ proBNP and high sensitivity troponin T ( hsTnT ) , which were measured at a core lab and not made available to providers .
local BNP and troponin assays were performed at the discretion of the treating providers .
outcomes were assessed at 30 days by medical record review and phone call .
of 3686 patients ( average age , 73 ; 51 % men ) , 62 % presented with syncope and 38 % with near syncope .
patients with serious diagnoses made in the ED ( 10.7 % ) were excluded ; 3177 patients had complete follow @-@ up data .
at 30 days , 5.7 % of patients had experienced a serious cardiac event and 26 had died ( 0.82 % ) .
the final decision instrument included five variables : history of heart failure , history of arrhythmia , abnormal electrocardiogram , elevated NT @-@ proBNP , and elevated hsTnT .
the presence of one or more variables had sensitivity of 96.7 % and specificity of 22.2 % .
even if successfully validated , this decision instrument won 't be very useful because the low specificity would result in nearly 80 % of patients being admitted , which doesn 't improve on standard treatment .
this large well @-@ done study again exemplifies the difficulty in determining who is and who is not safe to send home after a syncopal event .
new recommendations are provided on risk assessment , endoscopic therapy , and management of bleeding in the setting of antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs .
sponsoring Organization : Canadian Association of Gastroenterology
target Audience : gastroenterologists , emergency department clinicians , surgeons , primary care clinicians , and all those treating nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( NVUGIB )
since the previous guideline from this international expert consensus group was published in 2010 , there are new data available , new endoscopic technologies , increasing use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents , and multiple other published guidelines .
these changes prompted a rigorous evidence @-@ based update of recommendations .
Preendoscopy assessment with the Glasgow @-@ Blatchford scoring system is recommended for low @-@ risk stratification .
optimal proton @-@ pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy for high @-@ risk lesions now excludes twice @-@ daily intravenous bolus dosing and includes tapering of oral PPIs .
hemostatic sprays are recommended for temporary hemostasis .
more @-@ comprehensive recommendations are provided on managing bleeding in the setting of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy .
after hemodynamic stabilization , use the Glasgow @-@ Blatchford scoring system to identify patients with a score ≤ 1 , who may be treated as outpatients .
give blood transfusions only to patients with a hemoglobin level < 80 g / L , unless cardiovascular disease warrants a higher hemoglobin level .
do not delay endoscopy or endoscopic therapy in patients receiving anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists or direct @-@ acting anticoagulants .
perform endoscopy within 24 hours of admission for acute NVUGIB .
for active bleeding or ulcers with high @-@ risk stigmata for rebleeding , consider use of thermocoagulation , sclerosant injection , or through @-@ the @-@ scope clips .
for actively bleeding ulcers , use hemostatic spray for temporary hemostasis when other methods fail but not as definitive therapy alone .
after successful endoscopic therapy , prescribe a PPI bolus and then continuous infusion for 3 days , followed by twice @-@ daily oral PPI therapy for 14 days and then once @-@ daily PPI therapy .
prescribe concomitant PPI therapy in patients with prior ulcer bleeding who require ongoing antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy .
no recommendation is made either for or against the use of Doppler endoscopic probes to guide endoscopic therapy .
although significant therapeutic advances have been made , many of the basic principles of NVUGIB management remain unchanged .
the current guideline includes revised guidance on PPI therapy , which will represent a major change in practice for many clinicians .
the recommendation of a hemoglobin 80 g / L transfusion threshold is higher than the 70 g / L recommended in some other guidelines .
overall , this extensive evaluation and critical grading of the evidence provides a comprehensive review of the existing data on all aspects of NVUGIB .
however , the quality of evidence for many of the recommendations is low or very low , suggesting the need for additional research on these issues .
patients who are treated with targeted temperature management after out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest with shockable rhythm are at increased risk for ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia .
the benefit of preventive short @-@ term antibiotic therapy has not been shown .
either intravenous amoxicillin @-@ clavulanate ( at doses of 1 g and 200 mg , respectively ) or placebo was administered three times a day for 2 days , starting less than 6 hours after the cardiac arrest .
the primary outcome was early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia ( during the first 7 days of hospitalization ) .
an independent adjudication committee determined diagnoses of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia .
a total of 198 patients underwent randomization , and 194 were included in the analysis .
after adjudication , 60 cases of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia were confirmed , including 51 of early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia .
the incidence of early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia was lower with antibiotic prophylaxis than with placebo ( 19 patients [ 19 % ] vs. 32 [ 34 % ] ; hazard ratio , 0.53 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.31 to 0.92 ; P = 0.03 ) .
no significant differences between the antibiotic group and the control group were observed with respect to the incidence of late ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia ( 4 % and 5 % , respectively ) , the number of ventilator @-@ free days ( 21 days and 19 days ) , ICU length of stay ( 5 days and 8 days if patients were discharged and 7 days and 7 days if patients had died ) , and mortality at day 28 ( 41 % and 37 % ) .
at day 7 , no increase in resistant bacteria was identified .
serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups .
a 2 @-@ day course of antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin @-@ clavulanate in patients receiving a 32 @-@ to @-@ 34 ° C targeted temperature management strategy after out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest with initial shockable rhythm resulted in a lower incidence of early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia than placebo .
no significant between @-@ group differences were observed for other key clinical variables , such as ventilator @-@ free days and mortality at day 28 . ( Funded by the French Ministry of Health ; ANTHARTIC ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT02186951 . )
despite improved management , overall survival rates at hospital discharge among patients with out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrests do not exceed 20 % , and neurologic outcomes remain poor.1
even though controversies persist , targeted temperature management at 32 to 36 ° C remains recommended in patients with out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest with initial shockable rhythm , 2 since it has beneficial effects on morbidity and mortality.3
however , targeted temperature management is associated with an increased risk of secondary infections4,5 and constitutes an independent risk factor for early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia.5,6
the key early study suggesting the benefit of single @-@ day administration of cefuroxime in patients with coma was performed more than 20 years ago.7
few studies have been conducted since , including one single @-@ center , small , unblinded , prospective , randomized , controlled trial8 and one prospective , nonrandomized cohort study.9
moreover , several retrospective studies showed a decreased incidence of infectious complications and decreased related morbidity when antibiotic therapy was given early to patients receiving targeted temperature management after cardiac arrest.10 @-@ 12
therefore , we hypothesized that systematic administration of empirical 2 @-@ day antibiotic therapy could prevent early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia and related complications in patients with out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest treated with targeted temperature management , without clinically or biologically significant adverse effects , and could reduce intensive care unit ( ICU ) and hospital lengths of stay and medical costs related to ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia .
with consideration of the most frequently isolated bacteria in early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia after out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrests5 and treatment duration in previous studies7 @-@ 9 and to avoid the development of antibiotic resistance with prolonged antibiotic therapy , 13 2 @-@ day treatment with amoxicillin @-@ clavulanate was chosen for the Antibiotherapy during Therapeutic Hypothermia to Prevent Infectious Complications ( ANTHARTIC ) trial .
this was a randomized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled trial conducted in 16 ICUs in France ( university and nonuniversity hospitals ) .
the trial was approved by the Limoges Ethics Committee .
written informed consent was obtained from a relative of each patient or through an emergency consent procedure .
the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol , which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org .
adult patients ( > 18 years of age ) hospitalized in the ICU after an out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest with shockable rhythm and treated with 32 @-@ to @-@ 34 ° C targeted temperature management were eligible ; eligibility criteria were based on previous randomized , controlled trials.14,15
exclusion criteria were out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest with nonshockable rhythm , in @-@ hospital cardiac arrest , ongoing pneumonia or gross aspiration identified during direct laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation and confirmed by the presence of lung infiltrates on chest radiographs at admission , pregnancy , previous lung disease precluding accurate interpretation of chest radiographs , the use of extracorporeal life support , ongoing antibiotic therapy or during the week before admission , known chronic colonization with multidrug @-@ resistant bacteria , known allergy to beta @-@ lactam antibiotics , contraindications to amoxicillin or clavulanate , predictable decision of early care limitation ( within 7 days ) , moribund status , and participation in another trial within the previous 30 days .
patients had to undergo randomization within 6 hours after the return of spontaneous circulation to uniformly start antibiotics early enough to prevent early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia .
patients in the antibiotic group received a 2 @-@ day antibiotic therapy ( amoxicillin @-@ clavulanate at a dose of 1 g and 200 mg , respectively , with three injections per day ) , whereas patients in the control group received saline at the same frequency ( three injections per day for 2 days ) .
targeted temperature management was maintained at 32 to 34 ° C for 24 to 36 hours , and body temperature was monitored hourly .
although the sedation protocol , the use of neuromuscular blockade agents , and the method of targeted temperature management were left to the investigators " discretion , rapid initiation of targeted temperature management was required ( e.g. , infusion of iced saline ) .
when indicated and after careful documentation , all patients who had a secondary infection received curative antibiotic therapy according to local guidelines .
patients were randomly assigned by means of a secure , computer @-@ generated , Web @-@ response system in a 1 : 1 ratio .
randomization was stratified according to center , and the sequence was computer generated by a statistician not involved in recruitment using a fixed block size of four units .
patients , care providers , and members of the adjudication committee were unaware of the trial @-@ group assignments . ( for details on the procedure for adjudicating ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia , see the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org. )
daily during the ICU stay , patients were evaluated for nosocomial infections , especially ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia .
patients " vital status and scores on the Cerebral Performance Category scale were followed during 12 months ( months 3 , 6 , and 12 ) .
the primary outcome was the onset of early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia ( during the first 7 days of hospitalization ) .
because there is no universally accepted cutoff value to differentiate early from late ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia , 16 we purposely used 7 rather than 5 days of hospitalization to better assess the potential benefit of a 2 @-@ day antibiotic treatment and to best document microbiologically the cases of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia .
the main secondary outcomes were late ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia ( after day 7 of hospitalization through ICU discharge or death ) , other nosocomial infections ( bloodstream and urinary tract infections ) , mortality at day 28 , intestinal acquisition of multidrug @-@ resistant bacteria on day 7 according to solid selective media for the detection of such bacteria in stool samples ( enterobacteria resistant to third @-@ generation cephalosporins , carbapenemase @-@ producing enterobacteria , methicillin @-@ resistant Staphylococcus aureus , and vancomycin @-@ resistant enterococcus on the Drigalski @-@ MacConkey BLSE , the chromID CARBA SMART , the chromID MRSA , and the chromID VRE agar plates , respectively [ bioMérieux ] ) , percentage of days with antibiotic use ( outside the trial intervention ) during the ICU stay , length of stay in the ICU , number of ventilator @-@ free days until day 28 , and costs consequence analysis .
diagnosis OF VENTILATOR @-@ ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA AND ADJUDICATION PROCESS
routine use of a bundle of measures for the prevention of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia ( elevation of the head of the bed , daily " sedation vacations " and assessment of readiness to extubate , and deep @-@ vein thrombosis prophylaxis ) and daily oral care were highly recommended , and specific attention was given to standardize patient care.17
in cases of suspected ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia , the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score were assessed , and bedside anteroposterior chest radiography , arterial blood gas analysis , blood cultures , and quantitative sampling of the lower respiratory tract18 ( by either bronchoalveolar lavage or endotracheal aspiration , at the discretion of the attending physician ) were performed before any antibiotics were administered .
an adjudication committee , composed of three senior intensivists who had experience in trials of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia and who were unaware of the trial @-@ group assignments , reviewed all patients " medical charts and adjudicated all respiratory tract infections .
such infections were defined as early if they occurred within 7 days after randomization and as late if they occurred after 7 days , according to an adjudication charter ( see the Supplementary Appendix ) and the definition of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia .
to confirm reported clinical ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia , the events were defined in a standardized approach with the use of criteria from 2010 Food and Drug Administration guidance for diagnosis and confirmation of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia , 19 which relies on clinical , radiologic , and microbiologic criteria ( patients had to meet all three types of criteria ) .
clinical criteria were documented fever or hypothermia ( with fever defined as an oral or tympanic temperature ≥ 38 ° C and hypothermia defined as a core body temperature < 35 ° C ) , an abnormal total peripheral white @-@ cell count ( > 10,000 per cubic millimeter or > 15 % immature neutrophils [ bands ] , regardless of white @-@ cell count , or leukopenia with a white @-@ cell count < 4500 per cubic millimeter ) , new @-@ onset purulent sputum or change in the character of sputum , and a Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score of more than 6 ( scores range from 0 to 10 , with higher scores associated with a greater probability of pneumonia ) plus at least one of the following two features : auscultatory findings on pulmonary examination of rales or evidence of pulmonary consolidation , or acute changes made in the ventilator support system to enhance oxygenation , as determined by arterial blood gas analysis , or a worsening ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen .
radiographic criteria were the presence of new or progressive and persistent infiltrate characteristic of bacterial pneumonia or new consolidation .
microbiologic criteria were a respiratory culture that was positive and at the specified thresholds to be considered clinically significant amounts , as determined by standard culture ( endotracheal aspirate , 106 colony @-@ forming units [ CFU ] per milliliter ; bronchoalveolar @-@ lavage specimen , 104 CFU per milliliter ) .
the intensivists had access to all monitored data , chest radiographs obtained during the ICU stay , and microbiologic documentation .
two of them analyzed data from every patient independently , and in case of disagreement , the third one arbitrated the diagnosis of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia .
all secondary infections that occurred during the ICU stay were also recorded .
to document the potential emergence of multidrug @-@ resistant bacteria , a rectal swab was obtained on day 0 and day 7 for central laboratory analysis .
in the control group , we assumed that the incidence of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia on day 7 would reach 68 % , since other trials showed an incidence of 63 % 20 and 65 % .5
hypothesizing a 25 % lower incidence of early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia in the antibiotic group than in the control group on the basis of previous randomized , controlled trials7 @-@ 9 and considering a two @-@ sided , 5 % type I error rate and 90 % power , we calculated that the required number of events to be observed was 91 and the required number of patients to be included was 163 .
because death was a competing event relative to ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia , the sample size was adjusted with the use of Schulgen 's approach.21
considering a mortality of 15 % ( without previous occurrence of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia ) , we calculated that 192 patients ( 163 ÷ 0.85 ) were needed .
patients who did not receive any dose of amoxicillin @-@ clavulanate or placebo were excluded from the analysis.22
cumulative incidence curves of the primary outcome were estimated and compared with the use of the Fine @-@ Gray approach.23
no adjustment for multiple testing on secondary outcomes was performed .
the between @-@ group difference in mortality at day 28 was estimated on the basis of the two @-@ sided 95 % confidence interval .
for the percentage of days with antibiotic use during the ICU stay and the number of ventilator @-@ free days until day 28 , two @-@ sided 95 % confidence intervals of median differences were estimated on the basis of the Hodges @-@ Lehmann estimator.24
safety data were assessed with the use of chi @-@ square tests .
statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS software , version 9.4 ( SAS Institute ) , and R software , version 3.3.1 .
demographic AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS
from August 18 , 2014 to September 14 , 2017 , a total of 1116 patients were screened in the emergency departments of the trial centers , and 198 were included and underwent randomization ( median age , 61 years [ interquartile range , 50 to 73 ] ; 80 % men ) .
the main reasons for screening failure were out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest with nonshockable rhythm , in @-@ hospital cardiac arrest , an interval of 6 hours or longer between the return of spontaneous circulation and randomization , aspiration pneumonia , and moribund status .
four patients ( all assigned to receive placebo ) were excluded after randomization because they did not receive any injection or they withdrew their consent .
finally , 194 patients were included in the analysis ( 99 in the antibiotic group and 95 in the control group ) ( Figure 1 ) .
targeted temperature management was initiated a median of 5.4 hours ( interquartile range , 4.3 to 6.1 ) after out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest .
external cooling was used in 87 % of the patients in each group .
patients " characteristics are presented in Table 1 .
a total of 80 cases of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia were reported by the investigators ( 31 [ 31 % of the patients ] in the antibiotic group and 49 [ 52 % ] in the control group ) , of which 60 cases were assessed as ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia by the adjudication committee ( 23 [ 23 % ] in the antibiotic group and 37 [ 39 % ] in the control group ) .
the adjudication committee only reported cases with pathogen documentation .
respiratory sampling was performed with the use of bronchoalveolar lavage and mini @-@ bronchoalveolar lavage in 31 patients and endotracheal aspiration in 29 patients .
the initial rate of agreement between the two adjudicators was 78 % , and for the remaining cases with disagreement , a decision was made by the referee adjudicator .
there were 51 cases of early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia and 9 cases of late ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia .
the incidence of early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia was lower among patients who received amoxicillin @-@ clavulanate than among those who received placebo ( cumulative incidence on day 7 , 19 % vs. 34 % ; hazard ratio , 0.53 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.31 to 0.92 ; P = 0.03 ) ( Figure 2A ) , whereas the occurrence of late ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia was similar in the two groups ( 4 of 99 patients and 5 of 95 patients , respectively ) .
similar results were obtained when we used the 5 @-@ day cutoff value to distinguish early from late ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia ( cumulative incidence on day 5 , 17 % in the antibiotic group vs. 31 % in the control group ; hazard ratio , 0.53 ; 95 % CI , 0.30 to 0.95 ; P = 0.03 ) .
no significant difference in the incidence of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia was observed when the method of targeted temperature management was considered ( P = 0.49 for interaction ) , and no effect of trial center was noted .
overall , the risk of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia was lower among patients who received antibiotics than those who received placebo ( hazard ratio , 0.55 ; 95 % CI , 0.33 to 0.91 ) ( Figure 2B ) .
nonpulmonary secondary infectious complications were equally distributed between the two groups ( Table 2 ) .
the median percentage of days with antibiotic use ( outside the trial intervention ) during the ICU stay tended to be lower in the antibiotic group than in the control group ( 23 % [ interquartile range , 0 to 64 ] vs. 50 % [ 0 to 70 ] ; median difference , 0 days ; 95 % CI , − 15 to 0 ) .
the trial procedure did not significantly influence the median number of ventilator @-@ free days ( 21 [ interquartile range , 0 to 26 ] and 19 [ interquartile range , 0 to 25 ] , respectively ; median difference , 0 days ; 95 % CI , 0 to 0 ) .
the median ICU length of stay did not differ significantly between the two groups , regardless of whether patients were discharged ( 5 days [ interquartile range , 3.5 to 8.5 ] in the antibiotic group and 8 days [ interquartile range , 3 to 11 ] in the control group ) or had died ( 7 days [ interquartile range , 4 to 12 ] and 7 days [ interquartile range , 5 to 9 ] , respectively ) .
mortality at day 28 was 39 % and did not differ significantly between the two groups ( 41 % in the antibiotic group and 37 % in the control group ; difference , 4 percentage points ; 95 % CI , − 10 to 18 ) ( Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ) .
no death was attributable to ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia or sepsis .
more than half the patients who were enrolled had a good neurologic outcome ( Cerebral Performance Category of 1 or 2 , on a scale from 1 [ good cerebral performance ] to 5 [ death or brain death ] ) on day 28 .
this percentage was similar at 3 months and 12 months ( Table S2 ) .
microbiologic FINDINGS
microbiologic documentation of early and late ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia in each group is presented in Table 3 and Table S3 , respectively .
colonization cases were excluded from the analysis by the adjudication committee and are not reported .
most cases of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia were polymicrobial ( 60 % ) , with two bacteria per sample and a majority of gram @-@ negative bacilli .
in the control group , the main causative microorganisms were Haemophilus influenzae ( 16 cases [ 24 % of the pathogens in this group ] ) and Escherichia coli ( 8 cases [ 12 % ] ) with respect to gram @-@ negative bacilli , and S. aureus ( 8 cases [ 12 % ] ) and Streptococcus pneumoniae ( 6 cases [ 9 % ] ) with respect to gram @-@ positive cocci .
in the antibiotic group , S. aureus had the highest incidence for gram @-@ positive cocci ( 4 cases [ 10 % ] ) .
the main relevant difference in terms of microbiologic pattern was for gram @-@ negative bacilli , with more cases of enterobacteria such as Serratia marcescens ( 4 cases [ 10 % ] ) , Hafnia alvei ( 3 cases [ 7 % ] ) , and klebsiella species ( 4 cases [ 10 % ] ) in the antibiotic group than in the control group .
two strains were resistant to the third @-@ generation medication cephalosporin , one Enterobacter cloacae in the control group and one Klebsiella pneumoniae in the antibiotic group among patients with early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia .
Pseudomonas aeruginosa was documented in 6 ( 6 % ) of the samples , half of them from patients who had late ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia .
the microbiologic pattern of late ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia was predominantly gram @-@ negative bacilli ( 13 cases [ 81 % ] ) and especially enterobacteria .
rectal swabbing before and after the trial intervention did not show an emergence of multidrug @-@ resistant bacteria , with seven patients documented with such bacteria ( five in the control group and two in the antibiotic group ) at day 0 and eight patients ( seven in the control group and one in the antibiotic group ) at day 7 .
of 309 adverse events reported , 107 ( 35 % ) were reported as serious , without a significant difference between the antibiotic group and the control group ( 55 serious adverse events in 48 patients and 52 serious adverse events in 42 patients , respectively ; difference in incidence , 4 percentage points ; 95 % CI , − 10 to 18 ) .
most serious adverse events involved the nervous system ( 59 events ) , with the majority of such events being postanoxic encephalopathy ( 37 ) .
a total of 10 recurrences of cardiac arrest and 7 cases of multiple organ failure were also reported .
none of the serious adverse events was considered by investigators to be related to the trial intervention ( Table S4 ) .
in patients treated with targeted temperature management after resuscitation of out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrests with shockable rhythm , we found that a 2 @-@ day treatment with amoxicillin @-@ clavulanate resulted in a lower incidence of early ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia than placebo .
the overall 31 % incidence of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia that was observed in the current trial was lower than that previously reported in similar ICU populations.5,20,25,26
it is important that patients with overt aspiration were not enrolled in our trial and that systematic implementation of bundles known to decrease the incidence of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia in the ICU was highly recommended.27
the diagnosis of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia remains complex owing to considerable heterogeneity in its definition , 28,29 especially in patients with out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest receiving targeted temperature management .
to minimize a potential reporting bias , a central adjudication committee whose members were unaware of the trial @-@ group assignments diagnosed ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia on the basis of predefined criteria .
one fourth of the cases of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia that were initially reported by investigators were not subsequently confirmed during adjudication .
despite the potential eradication of microorganisms in the treatment group ( complicating the diagnosis of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia ) , the between @-@ group difference in the incidence of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia after adjudication tended to be smaller than the difference in the incidence of pneumonia reported by investigators during the trial period ( 16 percentage points after adjudication vs. 20 percentage points before adjudication ) .
overall , these specific factors presumably account for the lower incidence of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia in this trial than in previous trials , despite the fact that the characteristics were similar among the trial populations .
a randomized trial has previously shown that short @-@ term treatment with amoxicillin @-@ clavulanate failed to prevent ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia in patients with out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest as compared with placebo ( 50 % in both groups ) .30
nevertheless , this single @-@ center trial was underpowered and limited by the absence of adjudication of secondary infections .
less than 10 % of screened ICU patients were excluded for having an interval of 6 hours or longer between the return of spontaneous circulation and randomization .
in the present trial , the absence of effects of short @-@ term antibiotic therapy on the incidence of other secondary infections ( the incidence of which increases with targeted temperature management4,20 ) may have been related to the sample size and the lower incidence of these complications .
microbiologic documentation of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia in the control group was similar to that previously described in European ICUs , 5,10,20,25,30,31 with a predominance of gram @-@ negative bacteria susceptible to amoxicillin @-@ clavulanate.32
some authors suggested that such a therapeutic strategy could alter the microbiota and the epidemiology of secondary infections.33,34
in our limited sampling , we noted a higher frequency of enterobacteria among patients who received amoxicillin @-@ clavulanate than among those who received placebo ; however , the implications are unclear ( e.g. , similar incidence of P. aeruginosa and methicillin @-@ resistant S. aureus ) .9,35
no Clostridium difficile infection was reported .
in our trial , the 2 @-@ day course of amoxicillin @-@ clavulanate that was used was not associated with the emergence of difficult @-@ to @-@ treat microorganisms , as suggested previously , 36 although the number of events was fairly limited .
the trial treatment did not affect mortality at day 28 or the number of ventilator @-@ free days , findings that are consistent with that of previous research.7
this is presumably related to the low mortality attributable to ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia ( < 10 % ) among ICU patients.37,38
as expected , the prognosis of our population was mainly driven by neurologic outcome due to hypoxic ischemic brain injury39,40 ; most of the deaths were related to care withdrawal .
nevertheless , more than 50 % of the patients had a good neurologic outcome ( Cerebral Performance Category of 1 or 2 at month 12 ) .
the incidence of late ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia was not influenced by our intervention , a finding consistent with that of previous studies , 8,9 since late ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia is mostly driven by prolonged mechanical ventilation with a distinct microbiologic epidemiology .
our trial has some limitations .
first , even if risk factors for the development of ventilator @-@ associated pneumonia are not related to initial rhythm , 5,6 we cannot extend the benefit of the trial treatment to patients with an in @-@ hospital cardiac arrest or out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest with nonshockable rhythm .
second , patients with overt aspiration were not included in the trial .
third , microbiota analysis was designed to detect multidrug @-@ resistant bacteria only and was not repeated after day 7 .
it could be informative to better analyze the consequences of a short @-@ term antibiotic treatment on microbiota that play a role in the protective , structural , and metabolic gut function .
fourth , whether the present results apply to patients with out @-@ of @-@ hospital cardiac arrest whose condition is managed with a different targeted temperature remains to be determined .
in this Journal feature , information about a real patient is presented in stages ( boldface type ) to an expert clinician , who responds to the information by sharing relevant background and reasoning with the reader ( regular type ) .
a 51 @-@ year @-@ old man presented to his primary care physician with a 4 @-@ week history of cough associated with fever , chills , fatigue , and aching in the joints .
the cough was initially productive of blood @-@ tinged phlegm but later became dry .
shortly after the onset of symptoms , he had presented to an urgent care facility and received a prescription for azithromycin .
one week later , another physician prescribed clarithromycin to treat persistent symptoms .
the patient remained ill for the next 2 weeks without improvement .
he reported no nasal congestion , sore throat , headache , earache , dyspnea , nausea , diarrhea , dysuria , or rash .
the cough , fever , chills , fatigue , and arthralgia are typical of an acute viral respiratory infection , but the duration of the symptoms and the absence of rhinorrhea or pharyngitis make an acute viral respiratory infection unlikely .
the patient 's medical history included anxiety disorder and unprovoked deep @-@ vein thrombosis in his left leg ( 4 years earlier ) and right leg ( 3 years earlier ) .
both episodes of deep @-@ vein thrombosis were managed with short @-@ term anticoagulant therapy .
his medications were lorazepam , which he used rarely , and the recently prescribed antibiotic agents .
he had never smoked but had a history of heavy alcohol use ; his last alcoholic drink was several weeks before the onset of symptoms .
he was recently laid off from a landscaping job .
both parents had a history of lung cancer .
there was no family history of clotting or bleeding disorders .
the combination of a benzodiazepine agent and alcohol increases the risk of aspiration and lung abscess .
landscaping work puts the patient at risk for various pulmonary conditions .
chemicals ( such as pesticides ) and aerosolized organic compounds can cause a hypersensitivity pneumonitis .
landscaping work has also exposed him to soil @-@ based pathogens ( e.g. , nocardia or histoplasma ) that could infect the lung .
he has no known conditions that cause hypercoagulability , such as cancer , myeloproliferative disorder , or inflammatory bowel disease .
he may have an undiagnosed autoimmune condition that can cause both venous thrombosis and alveolar hemorrhage , such as Behçet 's disease or antiphospholipid antibody syndrome .
given the brief hemoptysis and ongoing arthralgia , I would consider additional autoimmune conditions with hemorrhagic pulmonary manifestations , such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( ANCA ) -associated vasculitis or systemic lupus erythematosus .
on physical examination , the patient 's temperature was 37.7 ° C , blood pressure 121 / 65 mm Hg , heart rate 88 beats per minute , and oxygen saturation 99 % while he was breathing ambient air .
he had no sinus tenderness , pharyngeal erythema , or cervical lymphadenopathy .
both lungs were clear to auscultation , although he had substantial coughing with inspiration .
his heart sounds were normal , and there was no murmur .
his abdomen was nontender .
no edema was observed in the arms or legs , and no rash was noted .
there was no erythema , tenderness , or effusion in the joints .
the white @-@ cell count was 13,900 per cubic milliliter , with 74 % polymorphonuclear leukocytes , 11 % lymphocytes , 9 % monocytes , 5 % eosinophils , and 1 % basophils .
the hemoglobin level was 14.0 g per deciliter , hematocrit 45 % , and platelet count 490,000 per cubic milliliter .
the basic metabolic panel ( including the creatinine level , which was 1.0 mg per deciliter [ 88 μmol per liter ] ) and liver biochemical test results were normal .
a radiograph of the chest showed an opacity at the right cardiophrenic angle but no pleural effusion ( Figure 1 ) .
thoracic computed tomography ( CT ) was scheduled , and a 7 @-@ day course of amoxicillin @-@ clavulanate was prescribed ; a follow @-@ up visit 2 weeks later was planned .
owing to a lack of transportation , the patient did not return for imaging or the clinic appointment .
the opacity seen on the radiograph may represent a right middle lobe collapse , infiltrate , or tumor .
an isolated opacity shifts the differential diagnosis away from autoimmune conditions , which tend to be multifocal .
a right middle lobe infiltrate could develop after an aspiration and could lead to a lung abscess .
lung cancer remains a possibility , especially given the patient 's family history .
the absence of hypoxemia , tachypnea , and rales raises the possibility of an extrapulmonary process such as a pericardial cyst , lymphadenopathy , mediastinal infection , or localized pericardial effusion .
one month later , his wife brought him to the emergency department , where he reported severe weakness , fatigue , and frequent muscle spasms .
he continued to have a nonproductive cough and was nauseated .
his wife noted that he seemed confused .
on physical examination , his temperature was 36.7 ° C , blood pressure 160 / 77 mm Hg , heart rate 75 beats per minute , respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute , and oxygen saturation 97 % while he was breathing ambient air .
his examination was unchanged from his previous outpatient visit except that he appeared lethargic , had mild tenderness over the right anterior chest wall , and had asterixis .
his confusion and lethargy can be characterized as encephalopathy , possibly arising from a toxic , metabolic , structural , or infectious process .
muscle spasms ( myoclonus ) are often incited by drugs , toxins , or metabolic abnormalities .
asterixis may reflect hepatic , uremic , or respiratory encephalopathy .
the focal tenderness over the chest wall suggests that the uncharacterized process seen on chest imaging may be irritating or even invading the chest wall .
cancer or infection ( e.g. , tuberculosis , actinomycosis , empyema , or lung abscess ) in the lung can extend into the pleural space or chest wall .
however , musculoskeletal pain from coughing is the most likely explanation .
the serum sodium level was 132 mmol per liter , potassium 8.0 mmol per liter , chloride 98 mmol per liter , bicarbonate 12 mmol per liter , blood urea nitrogen 176 mg per deciliter ( 63 mmol per liter ) , creatinine 22.6 mg per deciliter ( 1998 μmol per liter ) , glucose 132 mg per deciliter ( 7.3 mmol per liter ) , calcium 8.7 mg per deciliter ( 2.2 mmol per liter ) , and phosphorus 12.9 mg per deciliter ( 4.2 mmol per liter ) .
the serum albumin level was 2.1 g per deciliter ; the results of other liver biochemical tests were normal .
the white @-@ cell count was 14,600 per cubic milliliter , with 79 % neutrophils , 5 % lymphocytes , 6 % monocytes , 7 % eosinophils , 1 % basophils , and 2 % band forms ; hemoglobin 11.4 g per deciliter ; hematocrit 36.0 % ; and platelet count 458,000 per cubic milliliter .
the patient produced no urine despite placement of an indwelling urethral catheter .
anuria is caused by severe intrarenal injury or complete urinary obstruction .
in this patient with complete anuria , a urinalysis cannot be performed to determine whether a glomerular , tubular , interstitial , or vascular cause of renal injury is present .
renal ultrasonography is indicated to rule out bilateral ureteral obstruction ; bladder neck obstruction is unlikely given the anuria after placement of a catheter .
the use of antibiotics ( particularly amoxicillin @-@ clavulanate ) may have caused acute interstitial nephritis .
the moderate eosinophilia is consistent with drug @-@ induced renal injury , although it is unlikely that acute interstitial nephritis would have progressed without exposure to antibiotic therapy for 3 weeks .
if red cells ( particularly dysmorphic red cells or red cells in casts ) are found on urinalysis , a pulmonary @-@ renal syndrome characterized by hemoptysis and glomerulonephritis , such as an ANCA @-@ associated vasculitis or antiglomerular basement membrane ( anti @-@ GBM ) disease , may be present .
concomitant anemia and renal injury should prompt paraproteinemia testing to rule out multiple myeloma .
the patient 's uremic encephalopathy and hyperkalemia are indications for immediate dialysis .
the creatine kinase level was 31 U per liter ( normal range , 30 to 240 ) , thyrotropin 3.5 mIU per liter ( normal range , 0.3 to 5.6 ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate 75 mm per hour , and C @-@ reactive protein 27.4 mg per deciliter ( normal range , 0 to 7.5 ) .
the serum complement factor 3 was 101 mg per deciliter ( normal range , 70 to 156 ) , and the complement factor 4 was 81 mg per deciliter ( normal range , 15 to 56 ) .
tests for antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C viruses were negative .
CT of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis without contrast enhancement revealed a small right pleural effusion with associated atelectasis but no lung mass or lymphadenopathy .
the kidneys appeared mildly edematous without nephrolithiasis or hydronephrosis , and the bladder showed no evidence of urinary retention .
the patient was admitted to the hospital for hemodialysis and further evaluation .
prioritization of the differential diagnosis of kidney injury continues to be challenging owing to the lack of urine for analysis .
renal ischemia ( e.g. , venous thrombosis in both kidneys ) could lead to anuria .
both hemolytic uremic syndrome and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura are unlikely diagnoses without clear evidence of hemolysis .
Atheroembolism can cause acute kidney injury with eosinophilia and variable complement factor levels , but there has been no recent arterial procedure or anticoagulant use , nor is there any known atherosclerosis .
the cough , initial abnormality on the chest radiograph , new pleural effusion , and pleuritic pain suggest that pleuritis and pneumonitis are features of the underlying illness .
the absence of parenchymal opacities on CT may signify resolution of a bacterial or viral pneumonia that was seen on the chest radiograph .
the pleural effusion may reflect an underlying infectious , autoimmune , or malignant disease ; however , examination and imaging showed no evidence of cancer .
systemic lupus erythematosus affects the pleura and the glomerulus and can be heralded by hypercoagulability , but when the disease is active , it is usually associated with hypocomplementemia .
in contrast , complement factor levels are often normal in ANCA @-@ associated vasculitis or anti @-@ GBM disease , both of which have pulmonary and renal manifestations .
the most direct test to elucidate the cause of the patient 's pulmonary and renal disease would be a renal biopsy .
ancillary testing that would direct management includes tests for ANCA , antinuclear antibodies , double @-@ stranded DNA antibodies , and anti @-@ GBM antibodies .
the results of testing for antinuclear antibodies were negative .
anticardiolipin antibodies were not detected .
the antistreptolysin O antibody titer was 76 IU per milliliter ( normal range , 0 to 200 ) .
blood cultures were sterile , and a transthoracic echocardiogram was normal .
results of the indirect immunofluorescence assay for ANCAs were positive , with a cytoplasmic pattern and a titer of more than 1 : 640 ( normal value , < 1 : 20 ) .
the antiproteinase 3 antibody level was 39 U per milliliter ( normal range , 0 to 3.5 ) , and the myeloperoxidase antibody was not detected .
the anti @-@ GBM antibody level was 207 units ( normal range , 0 to 20 ) .
the markedly positive antiproteinase 3 and anti @-@ GBM antibody levels indicate a dual @-@ positive autoimmune phenotype .
both ANCA @-@ associated vasculitis and anti @-@ GBM disease cause rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis .
the pathogenic anti @-@ GBM antibodies affect the alveolar basement membranes and lead to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage ; these antibodies would not be expected to cause a focal pneumonitis or pleuritis .
ANCA @-@ associated vasculitides such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis or microscopic polyangiitis are more likely to have focal pulmonary and pleural involvement .
malaise , arthralgia , and extended illness are also more characteristic of an ANCA @-@ associated vasculitis than of anti @-@ GBM disease , which usually does not cause constitutional symptoms .
however , the patient does not have additional signs of ANCA @-@ associated vasculitis , such as upper airway disease , asthma , or rash .
many cases of anti @-@ GBM disease are idiopathic , although an antecedent infection or chemical exposure could be a precipitant .
there may be a mixed phenotype in which both pathogenic antibodies are mediating a pulmonary @-@ renal syndrome .
a renal biopsy , with tissue obtained for immunofluorescence , is needed to confirm anti @-@ GBM disease , which may be dominant in this hybrid disease .
if necrosis and crescents are found to involve a large percentage of glomeruli on biopsy , this finding would indicate a poor prognosis with respect to renal recovery .
the patient began empirical treatment with high @-@ dose intravenous methylprednisolone .
fluorescence microscopy showed bright linear immunofluorescence staining for IgG and complement along the glomerular basement membrane , which is pathognomonic for anti @-@ GBM disease .
a few arterioles had thrombotic microangiopathy that was more typical of ANCA @-@ associated disease .
on the basis of the clinical presentation , elevated antibody titers , and biopsy results , glomerulonephritis with coexistent ANCAs and anti @-@ GBM antibodies ( " double antibody @-@ positive " disease ) was diagnosed .
oral cyclophosphamide followed by rituximab and plasmapheresis were initiated .
the patient was discharged home by hospital day 15 , although he remained dependent on dialysis .
approximately 1 year later , he had no recurrent vasculitic events , and ANCA and anti @-@ GBM antibody levels were undetectable .
he was receiving treatment with mycophenolic acid on a daily basis and remained dependent on dialysis .
rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis is characterized by severe immune @-@ mediated glomerular injury .
renal or pulmonary biopsy , as well as a comprehensive serologic evaluation , guides the diagnostic process .
light microscopy of renal biopsy tissue typically shows glomerular inflammation , necrosis , and crescent formation .
direct immunofluorescence narrows the differential diagnosis .
a punctate or granular pattern is evidence of an immune deposition process such as lupus nephritis .
linear autoantibody deposition along glomerular basement membranes is pathognomonic for anti @-@ GBM disease .
a negative or pauci @-@ immune pattern ( without detectable antibody or complement ) is associated with the ANCA @-@ associated vasculitis syndromes of granulomatosis with polyangiitis , microscopic polyangiitis , and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.1
anti @-@ GBM disease is a pulmonary @-@ renal disorder that often manifests with both glomerulonephritis and alveolar hemorrhage .
this disease is caused by autoantibody @-@ mediated injury to the glomerular and alveolar basement membranes .
the autoantibody is expressed against the noncollagenous domain 1 of the alpha @-@ 3 chain of type IV collagen specific to specialized basement membranes of glomeruli and alveoli.2
pulmonary involvement is seen in 30 to 60 % of patients at presentation , is more common among smokers than nonsmokers , 3 and is manifested by cough , hemoptysis , dyspnea , and hypoxemia , with extensive alveolar infiltrates on chest imaging .
anti @-@ GBM disease is rare , with an estimated prevalence of less than 1 case per million persons per year , and is typically associated with a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis without prodromal symptoms .
this disease exhibits a bimodal distribution ; younger adults ( 20 to 40 years of age ) are more commonly men and typically present with a pulmonary @-@ renal syndrome , whereas older patients ( 60 years of age or older ) tend to be women and often present with isolated renal involvement.4
systemic manifestations usually develop before renal or pulmonary involvement and can include fever , malaise , myalgia , arthralgia , neuropathy , and other symptoms of organ dysfunction .
ANCA @-@ associated vasculitis usually occurs in adults 50 to 70 years of age , and the annual incidence is estimated to be 10 to 20 cases per million persons per year.6
rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with coexistent ANCAs and anti @-@ GBM antibodies is referred to as double antibody @-@ positive disease.7
up to one third of patients with anti @-@ GBM antibodies also have ANCAs ( usually myeloperoxidase ANCA ) .8,9
approximately 5 % of patients who are initially positive for ANCAs are found to have anti @-@ GBM antibodies.8
ANCAs and anti @-@ GBM antibodies do not react with one another , and ANCA does not interact with type IV collagen .
one proposed mechanism for double antibody @-@ positive disease is an initial ANCA @-@ associated vasculitis that causes glomerular basement membrane injury , with exposure of basement membrane antigens triggering subsequent anti @-@ GBM antibodies.10
patients with double antibody @-@ positive disease have hybrid clinical , prognostic , and pathologic features of anti @-@ GBM disease and ANCA @-@ associated vasculitis .
such patients often have extrarenal disease manifestations of ANCA @-@ associated conditions while also exhibiting more fulminant renal dysfunction similar to that seen in patients with anti @-@ GBM disease.11
independence from dialysis at 12 months after the onset of double positive @-@ antibody disease in these patients ranges from 26 to 53 % ; this degree of renal recovery is similar to that observed in anti @-@ GBM disease.8,12
therapy for double positive @-@ antibody disease mirrors treatment for anti @-@ GBM disease and typically involves high @-@ dose glucocorticoids , cyclophosphamide , and plasmapheresis.8,9,11,12
case series suggest that these treatments are unlikely to improve renal function in patients who are initially dependent on dialysis or who have a biopsy that shows a high percentage of glomeruli with crescents , although nonrenal manifestations may abate .
in contrast to anti @-@ GBM disease , ANCA @-@ associated vasculitis has a propensity to relapse .
long @-@ term follow @-@ up of patients with double antibody @-@ positive disease suggests that nearly half have disease relapse within 10 years , a relapse rate that is similar to that in patients with ANCA @-@ associated vasculitis.12
thus , prolonged immunosuppressant therapy with or without glucocorticoids is warranted in double antibody @-@ positive disease .
this patient had hybrid pathologic features of both diseases , including severe glomerular destruction typical of anti @-@ GBM disease and intrarenal thrombotic microangiopathy described with ANCA @-@ associated vasculitis.13
this patient 's initial symptoms ( cough , scant hemoptysis , fever , chills , arthralgia , and lingering malaise ) were characteristic of a respiratory infection .
after two urgent care visits , an appointment with his primary care physician provided an opportunity to expand the differential diagnosis .
however , the mild leukocytosis , the focal opacity seen on the chest radiograph , and the normal serum creatinine level were not highly suggestive of a pulmonary @-@ renal or other multisystem disorder .
a urinalysis performed at any of the patient 's earlier assessments might have revealed hematuria or casts , which would have prompted serologic testing for pulmonary @-@ renal disorders and might have led to earlier treatment to prevent renal failure .
when the patient returned for care , his severe renal injury led to prompt serologic analysis and renal biopsy .
as this case shows , full serologic testing in the context of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis may double the diagnosis - and double the trouble .
long @-@ term outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) with contemporary drug @-@ eluting stents , as compared with coronary @-@ artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) , in patients with left main coronary artery disease are not clearly established .
we randomly assigned 1905 patients with left main coronary artery disease of low or intermediate anatomical complexity ( according to assessment at the participating centers ) to undergo either PCI with fluoropolymer @-@ based cobalt @-@ chromium everolimus @-@ eluting stents ( PCI group , 948 patients ) or CABG ( CABG group , 957 patients ) .
the primary outcome was a composite of death , stroke , or myocardial infarction .
at 5 years , a primary outcome event had occurred in 22.0 % of the patients in the PCI group and in 19.2 % of the patients in the CABG group ( difference , 2.8 percentage points ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , − 0.9 to 6.5 ; P = 0.13 ) .
death from any cause occurred more frequently in the PCI group than in the CABG group ( in 13.0 % vs. 9.9 % ; difference , 3.1 percentage points ; 95 % CI , 0.2 to 6.1 ) .
in the PCI and CABG groups , the incidences of definite cardiovascular death ( 5.0 % and 4.5 % , respectively ; difference , 0.5 percentage points ; 95 % CI , − 1.4 to 2.5 ) and myocardial infarction ( 10.6 % and 9.1 % ; difference , 1.4 percentage points ; 95 % CI , − 1.3 to 4.2 ) were not significantly different .
all cerebrovascular events were less frequent after PCI than after CABG ( 3.3 % vs. 5.2 % ; difference , − 1.9 percentage points ; 95 % CI , − 3.8 to 0 ) , although the incidence of stroke was not significantly different between the two groups ( 2.9 % and 3.7 % ; difference , − 0.8 percentage points ; 95 % CI , − 2.4 to 0.9 ) .
ischemia @-@ driven revascularization was more frequent after PCI than after CABG ( 16.9 % vs. 10.0 % ; difference , 6.9 percentage points ; 95 % CI , 3.7 to 10.0 ) .
in patients with left main coronary artery disease of low or intermediate anatomical complexity , there was no significant difference between PCI and CABG with respect to the rate of the composite outcome of death , stroke , or myocardial infarction at 5 years . ( Funded by Abbott Vascular ; EXCEL ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT01205776 . )
percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) with drug @-@ eluting stents has emerged as an acceptable treatment for selected patients with left main coronary artery disease.1 @-@ 8
however , long @-@ term data from randomized trials comparing PCI involving contemporary drug @-@ eluting stents with coronary @-@ artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) in these patients are lacking .
in the Evaluation of XIENCE versus Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery for Effectiveness of Left Main Revascularization ( EXCEL ) trial , 2 which involved patients with left main coronary artery disease of low or intermediate anatomical complexity , PCI with everolimus @-@ eluting stents was noninferior to CABG with respect to the primary composite outcome measure of death , stroke , or myocardial infarction at a median 3 @-@ year follow @-@ up .
however , although the incidence of periprocedural adverse events ( within 30 days ) was lower in the PCI group , patients in the CABG group had fewer adverse events between 30 days and 3 years after the procedure .
to further characterize the long @-@ term outcomes of PCI as compared with CABG in patients with left main coronary artery disease , we report the final 5 @-@ year outcomes from this trial .
in brief , we performed an international , open @-@ label , multicenter , randomized trial that compared PCI involving thin @-@ strut cobalt @-@ chromium fluoropolymer @-@ based everolimus @-@ eluting stents ( XIENCE , Abbott Vascular ) with CABG in patients with left main coronary artery disease .
the organization of the trial is described and participating centers are listed in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org .
the protocol , also available at NEJM.org , was designed by the principal investigators and trial committees , in which interventional cardiologists and cardiac surgeons were represented equally .
the trial was approved by the investigational review board or ethics committee at each participating center , and written informed consent was obtained from all the patients .
the principal investigators had unrestricted access to the data , prepared the manuscript , and vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and analyses and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol .
patients were eligible to participate in the trial if they had stenosis of the left main coronary artery of 70 % or more ( as estimated visually ) or stenosis of 50 % to less than 70 % ( if determined by means of noninvasive or invasive testing to be hemodynamically significant ) and if a consensus among the members of the heart team had been reached regarding eligibility for revascularization with either PCI or CABG ( Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix ) .2,9
in addition , eligible patients had low or intermediate anatomical complexity of coronary artery disease , as assessed at the participating center and defined by a Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery ( SYNTAX ) score of 32 or less.10
the SYNTAX score reflects a comprehensive angiographic assessment of the coronary vasculature , with 0 as the lowest score , and higher scores ( no upper limit ) indicating more complex coronary anatomy .
randomization was performed with the use of an interactive voice @-@ based or Web @-@ based system in block sizes of 16 , 24 , or 32 , with stratification according to the presence or absence of diabetes , SYNTAX score , and trial center .
clinical follow @-@ up was performed at 1 month , 6 months , and 1 year and then annually through 5 years .
guideline @-@ directed medical therapy and management of risk factors were recommended for all the patients , as previously described.9
dual antiplatelet therapy was administered before PCI and for a minimum of 1 year thereafter .
aspirin was administered before and after CABG , and the use of clopidogrel during follow @-@ up was allowed but not mandatory .
routine angiographic follow @-@ up was not permitted .
the primary outcome was the composite of death from any cause , stroke , or myocardial infarction at 3 years .
major secondary outcomes included the primary outcome measure at 30 days and the composite of death , stroke , myocardial infarction , or ischemia @-@ driven revascularization at 3 years .
the cause of death was adjudicated as definite cardiovascular , definite noncardiovascular , or undetermined , and undetermined cases were conservatively classified as cardiovascular .
long @-@ term additional secondary outcomes included these measures and their components at 5 years , as well as therapy failure ( definite stent thrombosis or symptomatic graft stenosis or occlusion ) , all revascularizations , and all cerebrovascular events ( stroke or transient ischemic attack ) .
outcomes are defined in Table S2 .
trial monitors collected source documents of all primary and secondary outcome events for adjudication by an independent events committee .
the extent of disease and SYNTAX score were assessed at an angiographic core laboratory .
the trial was powered to show the noninferiority of PCI to CABG with respect to the primary outcome at 3 years.2,9
the 5 @-@ year secondary outcomes were prespecified but were not explicitly powered or adjusted for multiple comparisons .
the principal analyses were performed in the intention @-@ to @-@ treat population , which included all patients according to the group to which they were randomly assigned , regardless of the treatment received .
sensitivity analyses were performed in the per @-@ protocol and as @-@ treated populations , 9 with multiple imputation to account for missing follow @-@ up data.11
event rates were based on Kaplan @-@ Meier estimates in time @-@ to @-@ first @-@ event analyses .
however , the underlying assumption of proportional hazards in the Cox model for the primary and major secondary outcomes from randomization through 5 years was not met ( treatment @-@ time interaction , P < 0.001 ) .
principal comparisons between treatments were therefore performed by logistic regression with follow @-@ up time included as a log @-@ transformed offset variable ( no other covariates were included ) , with the use of an estimated standard error for the difference .
in a post hoc analysis , we also evaluated piecewise hazards models separately within 0 to 30 days ( the periprocedural period ) , 30 days to 1 year ( the major risk period for stent restenosis ) , and 1 year to 5 years ( long @-@ term follow @-@ up ) - intervals during which proportional hazards were preserved .
given the presence of nonproportional hazards , net treatment effects were also examined with the use of post hoc milestone and restricted mean survival time analyses ( Table S3 ) .
for milestone analysis , the percentage of patients with an event in each group was estimated with the Kaplan @-@ Meier method , and Greenwood 's formula was used to estimate standard errors .
the difference between groups in milestone event rates that occurred each day during the 5 @-@ year follow @-@ up period is reported .
restricted mean event @-@ free survival time is the mean time free from an outcome event adjusted for loss to follow @-@ up , reflecting the area under the survival curve.12
the difference between groups in the restricted mean survival time over the 5 @-@ year follow @-@ up period is reported .
categorical variables were compared with the use of the chi @-@ square test or Fisher 's exact test .
continuous variables were compared with the use of Student 's t @-@ test or the Wilcoxon rank @-@ sum test for non @-@ normally distributed data .
for superiority , a two @-@ sided P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance .
the 95 % confidence intervals for secondary outcomes were not adjusted for multiple comparisons , and therefore inferences drawn from these intervals may not be reproducible .
patients AND PROCEDURES
baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics were well balanced between the groups ( Tables S4 and S5 ) .
the mean ( ± SD ) age of the patients was 66.0 ± 9.6 years , 76.9 % of patients were male , and 29.1 % had diabetes .
the mean SYNTAX score was 20.6 ± 6.2 according to assessment at local sites and 26.5 ± 9.3 according to the angiographic core laboratory analysis , and 80.5 % of the patients had distal left main bifurcation disease .
procedural data are shown in Table S6 .
adherence to guideline @-@ directed medical therapy was high , although medication use differed between the groups during follow @-@ up ( Table S7 ) .
five @-@ year follow @-@ up was achieved in 93.2 % and 90.1 % of the PCI and CABG groups , respectively .
the primary composite of death , stroke , or myocardial infarction at 5 years occurred in 22.0 % of the patients in the PCI group and 19.2 % of the patients in the CABG group ( difference , 2.8 percentage points ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , − 0.9 to 6.5 ; P = 0.13 ) ( Table 1 and Figure 1A ) .
mean event @-@ free survival through 5 years was 5.2 days ( 95 % CI , − 46.1 to 56.5 ) longer after PCI than after CABG .
the treatment effect for the primary outcome in prespecified subgroups is shown in Figure 2 .
results were similar in the per @-@ protocol and as @-@ treated populations and after multiple imputation accounting for missing follow @-@ up data ( Tables S8 and S9 ) .
the secondary composite outcome of death , stroke , myocardial infarction , or ischemia @-@ driven revascularization at 5 years occurred in 31.3 % of the patients in the PCI group and 24.9 % of the patients in the CABG group ( difference , 6.5 percentage points ; 95 % CI , 2.4 to 10.6 ) ( Table 1 and Figure 1B ) .
the incidences of the individual components of the primary and secondary composite outcomes are shown in Table 1 and Figure 3 .
death from any cause occurred in 13.0 % of the patients in the PCI group and 9.9 % of the patients in the CABG group ( difference , 3.1 percentage points ; 95 % CI , 0.2 to 6.1 ) .
Eighteen of the 30 excess deaths in the PCI group were adjudicated as noncardiovascular deaths , 5 as definite cardiovascular deaths , and 7 as being of undetermined cause ( Table S10 ) .
the results were similar after accounting for patients who were lost to follow @-@ up ( Table S9 ) .
the incidences of stroke and myocardial infarction at 5 years did not differ significantly between the PCI group and the CABG group .
ischemia @-@ driven revascularization within 5 years was performed more frequently after PCI than after CABG , whereas the incidences of all cerebrovascular events and definite stent thrombosis or symptomatic graft stenosis or occlusion at 5 years were less frequent with PCI than with CABG .
the hazard ratios for the secondary outcomes between 0 to 30 days , 30 days to 1 year , and 1 year to 5 years are provided in Table 2 .
patients with left main coronary artery disease have a poor prognosis because of the large amount of myocardium at risk.13
survival among patients with left main coronary artery disease is longer after revascularization with either PCI or CABG than with medical therapy alone.14
in six randomized trials involving patients with left main coronary artery disease , PCI with drug @-@ eluting stents was associated with more favorable outcomes at 1 year than CABG , with fewer periprocedural adverse events and more rapid recovery.3,4,15
conversely , conflicting long @-@ term findings from these trials have been reported.1,3 @-@ 5
however , to achieve adequate power , these trials relied on differences in the incidence of repeat revascularization , an outcome of lesser importance to physicians and patients than death , stroke , and myocardial infarction.16
the degree of deterioration in health status that triggers repeat revascularization is also greater after CABG than after PCI ; this calls into question the parity of this outcome.17,18
in addition , previous trials did not use contemporary drug @-@ eluting stents , which have a better safety profile than that of earlier devices .
the present trial was powered to examine the composite rate of death , stroke , or myocardial infarction .
current @-@ generation fluoropolymer @-@ based thin @-@ strut cobalt @-@ chromium everolimus @-@ eluting stents , which are associated with a low incidence of stent thrombosis , were used , 19,20 and contemporary CABG techniques were incorporated.2,9
we did not detect a significant difference in the composite rate of death , stroke , or myocardial infarction at 5 years between patients with left main coronary artery disease and low or intermediate anatomical complexity ( as defined by a site @-@ reported SYNTAX score of ≤ 32 ) who underwent PCI and those who underwent CABG .
this finding was consistent across important subgroups , including patients with diabetes and those without diabetes and patients with lower and higher SYNTAX scores .
however , interpreting these results as showing no difference between treatments is simplistic .
as shown by the piecewise hazards analysis , three distinct periods of relative risk were present : from 0 to 30 days , when PCI resulted in fewer primary outcome events than CABG ; from 30 days to 1 year , when the incidence of the events was similar among patients in each treatment group ; and from 1 to 5 years , when primary outcome events were less common after CABG than after PCI .
consideration of the differential timing of risk is clinically relevant , since earlier exposure to adverse events has a more profound influence on the long @-@ term burden of disease than exposure to events occurring later .
as shown by the analysis of milestones and restricted mean survival time , by 5 years , the early benefit of PCI due to reduced periprocedural risk was attenuated by the greater number of events that occurred during follow @-@ up than with CABG , such that the cumulative mean time free from adverse events was similar in the two treatment groups .
there were numerical differences between PCI and CABG in several nonpowered secondary outcomes .
the event rates of death from any cause ( a 3.1 @-@ percentage @-@ point difference between the groups ) and repeat revascularization ( a 6.9 @-@ percentage @-@ point difference ) favored CABG , whereas event rates of cerebrovascular events ( a 1.9 @-@ percentage @-@ point difference ) and therapy failure ( a 5.4 @-@ percentage @-@ point difference ) favored PCI .
rates of myocardial infarction at 5 years were similar in the two groups , but they favored PCI in the periprocedural period and CABG during long @-@ term follow @-@ up .
although some of these findings may indicate true treatment effects , they must be interpreted cautiously , since more than 20 secondary outcomes were assessed and analyses were not adjusted for multiple comparisons .
nonetheless , several findings warrant comment .
although the cause of death can sometimes be ambiguous , rates of adjudicated definite cardiovascular death were similar among patients who underwent PCI and those who underwent CABG , consistent with the similar rates of myocardial infarction at 5 years .
the difference in all @-@ cause mortality between the groups was driven by noncardiovascular deaths , especially those from cancer and infection , which occurred more commonly after PCI during late follow @-@ up .
whereas previous studies have shown higher rates of stroke after CABG than after PCI , 23 the excess of cerebrovascular events after CABG in the present trial was driven more by transient ischemic attacks than by strokes .
the greater observed incidence of repeat revascularization after the use of drug @-@ eluting stents than after CABG is consistent with previous analyses , but most revascularization events were repeat PCI procedures ; only 1 of 25 patients initially treated with everolimus @-@ eluting stents underwent CABG within 5 years .
nonetheless , repeat revascularization procedures may be associated with myocardial infarction and death.24
these considerations notwithstanding , the absolute 5 @-@ year differences between the groups with respect to all the secondary outcomes were relatively modest , and some may have been due to chance .
this perspective should be considered in discussions between the heart team and the patient when weighing the pros and cons of the different therapies.25
additional limitations of this trial should be considered .
first , bias in event ascertainment cannot be ruled out given the open @-@ label trial design .
second , although the trial excluded patients with high SYNTAX scores , approximately 25 % of the patients met this criterion according to the core laboratory analysis .
although the primary outcome results were consistent in this subgroup , further studies are needed to determine the most appropriate treatment for patients with left main coronary artery disease and high anatomical complexity .
third , a specific biomarker @-@ based definition of large periprocedural myocardial infarction was used in the present trial2,6 ; this definition differs from the criteria used in the Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction26 ( which was developed while the current trial was ongoing ) and the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction27 ( which was developed subsequently ) .
the definition used in the EXCEL trial is based on previously established criteria that have been shown to be prognostically relevant after PCI and after CABG and that minimize ascertainment bias.28
as previously reported , the occurrence of periprocedural myocardial infarction according to this protocol definition was independently predictive of late death from cardiovascular causes and death from any cause after PCI and after CABG , whereas lesser degrees of elevated levels of biomarkers were not.29
fourth , patients who underwent PCI , as compared with those who underwent CABG , more commonly received dual antiplatelet therapy and inhibitors of the renin @-@ angiotensin axis during follow @-@ up , whereas patients who underwent CABG more commonly received oral anticoagulants , beta @-@ blockers , diuretics , and antiarrhythmic agents ; these differences reflect inherent differences between the procedures and their resulting complications .
the extent to which variability in medication use contributed to the present results is uncertain .
finally , follow @-@ up was limited to 5 years , and at this time point the hazard curves were continuing to diverge .
TEN @-@ year ( or longer ) follow @-@ up is needed to characterize the very late safety profiles of PCI and CABG , since both stents and bypass grafts progressively fail over time .
in conclusion , in the present trial we did not find a significant difference between PCI and CABG with respect to rates of the composite outcome of death , stroke , or myocardial infarction at 5 years among patients with left main coronary artery disease and low or intermediate anatomical complexity ( as defined by the SYNTAX score ) according to assessment at the participating centers .
however , much of the supporting research on diet and NAFLD has been performed in ethnically nondiverse populations .
now , researchers have examined these associations in a nested case @-@ control study within a large , prospective , multiethnic cohort study in California and Hawaii .
nearly 3000 NAFLD cases were identified using Medicare claims data and were matched to approximately 30,000 controls without liver disease by birth year , sex , ethnicity , and length of Medicare enrollment .
diet was assessed using a validated questionnaire at baseline .
five hundred patients with NAFLD had cirrhosis .
the study population comprised 50 % Japanese @-@ Americans , 21 % Latinos , 16 % whites , 7 % African @-@ Americans , and 6 % Native Hawaiians .
NAFLD was significantly associated with higher consumption of red meat ( odds ratio , 1.16 ) , processed red meat ( OR , 1.18 ) , poultry ( OR , 1.16 ) , and cholesterol ( OR , 1.16 ) and lower dietary fiber intake ( OR , 0.84 ) .
associations were generally similar across race and ethnicity groups .
this study confirms that diets high in consumption of meats and cholesterol and low in fiber are associated with NAFLD , seemingly independent of race and ethnicity .
providing patients with dietary recommendations should remain primary in treating NAFLD in all racial and ethnic populations .
hypoglycemia also was lower with linagliptin , but cost - generally much lower for sulfonylureas - is still a factor .
sulfonylureas are inexpensive , but their adverse event and safety profile compared with newer more @-@ costly diabetes drugs might be unfavorable .
in an industry @-@ funded trial - which included employees of linagliptin 's manufacturer on the study team - more than 6000 patients were randomized to oral linagliptin ( Tradjenta ; 5 mg / day ) or glimepiride ( 1 mg / day , titrated up to 4 mg / day ) .
patients ( mean age , 64 ) were either naive to sulfonylurea therapy or had discontinued this therapy , were at high risk for cardiovascular ( CV ) disease , and had glycosylated hemoglobin levels of 6.5 % to 8.5 % .
patients otherwise were treated as needed for glycemic control or other conditions .
during a median follow @-@ up of longer than 6 years , no significant difference was noted between the two groups in incidence of major adverse CV events , including death , myocardial infarction , or stroke ( 11.8 % for linagliptin and 12.0 % for glimepiride ) .
no difference was found between groups in serious adverse events that required hospitalization ( roughly 42 % ) , but significant differences occurred in investigator @-@ reported hypoglycemia ( 2.3 per 100 person @-@ years with linagliptin vs. 11.1 per 100 person @-@ years with glimepiride ) and severe hypoglycemic events ( 0.07 per 100 person @-@ years vs. 0.45 per 100 person @-@ years ) .
these results met the manufacturer 's objective , showing that linagliptin was noninferior to the sulfonylurea in terms of CV safety .
however , this outcome is not exactly a strong endorsement for linagliptin , given that concerns exist about the CV safety of sulfonylureas themselves .
if more careful dosing of glimepiride ( or stopping the drug when glycemic control became inappropriately tight ) could have averted some of the hypoglycemia observed in this study , the clinical differences between the two drugs would be narrowed ; however , the cost differential remains huge .

abemaciclib plus Trastuzumab and Fulvestrant for HR + , HER2 + Advanced Breast Cancer
Tolaney and colleagues presented results from the randomized , open @-@ label , phase II monarcHER study , in which 237 postmenopausal patients with hormone receptor @-@ positive ( HR + ) , human epidermal growth factor 2 @-@ positive ( HER2 + ) advanced breast cancer were randomized to one of three treatment arms : oral abemaciclib plus trastuzumab and fulvestrant ( arm A ) , abemaciclib plus trastuzumab ( arm B ) , or trastuzumab plus physician 's choice of single @-@ agent chemotherapy , most commonly vinorelbine , capecitabine , eribulin , or gemcitabine ( arm C ; abstract 1002 ) .
patients had prior exposure to ≥ 2 HER2 therapies , including trastuzumab emtansine ( T @-@ DM1 ) and a taxane .
they may have received another HER2 @-@ directed therapy but must not have received fulvestrant or a CDK4 / 6 inhibitor .
the study excluded patients with performance status ≥ 2 , left ventricular ejection fraction < 50 % , visceral crisis , or untreated symptomatic central nervous system metastases .
the most common grade ≥ 3 toxicities in arms A , B , and C were neutropenia ( 67.9 % , 50.6 % , and 48.6 % ) , thrombocytopenia ( 10.3 % , 6.5 % , and 2.8 % ) , diarrhea ( 9.0 % , 6.5 % , and 2.8 % ) , and anemia ( 9.0 % , 3.9 % , and 4.2 % ) .
although overall survival ( OS ) data were not available , the findings indicate that optimally targeting ER and HER in the absence of chemotherapy may be an appropriate strategy for some patients with advanced HR + , HER2 + disease .
atezolizumab plus T @-@ DM1 for HER2 + Advanced Breast Cancer
Emens and colleagues presented updated results of the randomized , placebo @-@ controlled , phase II KATE2 study of the PD @-@ L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus T @-@ DM1 versus T @-@ DM1 alone in previously treated patients with HER2 + advanced breast cancer ( abstract 3050 ) .
PD @-@ L1 + disease was present in 43 % of patients receiving combination therapy and in 39 % of those receiving T @-@ DM1 alone .
median OS was not reached in either arm , and the 1 @-@ year survival rate was the same in both arms ( 89 % ) , although it was numerically higher with combination therapy for patients with PD @-@ L1 + versus PD @-@ L1- disease ( 94.3 % and 87.9 % ) .
the safety profile of the combination arm was consistent with the known safety profile of each individual drug .
similarly , at the 2018 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium ( NEJM JW Oncol Hematol Feb 2019 ) , there was no significant difference in median PFS in breast cancer patients receiving atezolizumab and T @-@ DM1 versus T @-@ DM1 alone ( 8.2 and 6.8 months , respectively ) .
however , in patients with documented PD @-@ L1 + tumor infiltrating immune cells , there was a PFS advantage for combination therapy compared with T @-@ DM1 alone ( 8.5 vs. 4.1 months ) .
the OS results reported in the current study suggest a potential benefit for this combination of agents , but this regimen is not ready for routine use .
PD @-@ L1 Assays in Triple @-@ Negative Breast Cancer
at the 2018 ESMO Congress , Schmid and colleagues presented results of the Impassion 130 study , in which 902 patients with locally advanced or metastatic triple @-@ negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) who had not received prior treatment for metastatic disease were randomized to nab @-@ paclitaxel plus atezolizumab or to standard chemotherapy plus placebo .
the primary endpoints were PFS and OS .
in addition , several exploratory biomarkers were evaluated , including PD @-@ L1 tumor expression by Ventana SP142 , intratumoral CD8 , and stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ( sTILs ) .
the study showed that median OS was superior with nab @-@ paclitaxel plus atezolizumab versus standard chemotherapy in patients with PD @-@ L1 + tumors , ( 25.0 vs. 15.5 months ; HR , 0.62 ) as well as in all patients ( 21.3 vs. 17.6 months ) .
intratumoral CD8 correlated with PD @-@ L1 expression , whereas sTILs did not correlate well with PD @-@ L1 .
these data suggested that assessment of PD @-@ L1 expression is critical in treatment decisions and raised the issue of which assay is optimal to use among several available for assessing PD @-@ L1 .
at this year 's ESMO Congress , Rugo and colleagues offered a comparative analysis of different PD @-@ L1 immunohistochemistry assays ( SP142 , 22C3 , SP263 ) and the Impassion 130 dataset ( abstract 6571 ) .
SP142 was associated with lowest prevalence of PD @-@ L1 positivity compared with 22C3 and SP263 ( 46 % vs. 81 % and 75 % , respectively ) .
SP142 and 22C3 were positive in 45 % of cases , similar to SP142 and SP263 .
overall percentage agreement of SP142 with SP263 and 22C3 was 64 % and 69 % , respectively ; positive percentage agreement was 98 % for both .
SP142- was discordant with 22C3 + in 36 % and was associated with SP263 in 30 % , leading to negative percentage agreement of 34 % and 45 % .
additionally , with 22C3 + and SP263 + subgroups , SP142 + patients had numerically higher sTIL counts compared with SP142- patients .
double positive assay results ( SP142 + / 22C3 + or SP142 + / SP263 + ) were associated with superior PFS and OS compared with single @-@ positive or double @-@ negative results .
these data suggest that there are differences between the assays chosen to assess PD @-@ L1 status .
based on the results of this analysis , it is critical to have an understanding of the performance of available assays in order to best predict the likely benefit from the combination of atezolizumab and nab @-@ paclitaxel in advanced TNBC .
abemaciclib plus Fulvestrant for HR + , HER2 − Advanced Breast Cancer
Sledge and colleagues presented OS data from the randomized phase III MONARCH 2 trial of fulvestrant plus either abemaciclib or placebo in 669 patients with HR + , HER2 − metastatic breast cancer who had relapsed on neoadjuvant or adjuvant endocrine therapy within 1 year or had progressed on first @-@ line endocrine therapy for advanced disease ( abstract LBA6 ) .
early results of this trial , previously reported at the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) meeting , showed that PFS was prolonged with abemaciclib plus fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone ( 16.4 vs. 9.3 months ; P < 0.0000001 ) .
now , with median follow @-@ up of 47.7 months , the updated median PFS continues to favor abemaciclib plus fulvestrant ( median 16.9 vs 9.3 months ) .
in addition , abemaciclib plus fulvestrant significantly improved OS ( 46.7 vs. 37.3 months ; P = 0.0137 ) and significantly delayed the time to subsequent chemotherapy .
no new toxicities were identified compared with earlier reports .
ribociclib plus Fulvestrant for HR + , HER2 − Advanced Breast Cancer
Slamon and colleagues presented results of the phase III MONALEESA @-@ 3 trial of ribociclib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant for postmenopausal patients with HR + , HER2 − advanced breast cancer ( abstract LBA7 ) .
at a median follow @-@ up of 39.4 months , median OS was significantly improved with ribociclib plus fulvestrant versus fulvestrant alone ( not reached vs. 40.0 months ; HR , 0.724 ; P = 0.00455 ) .
these results applied to patients who were pre- or postmenopausal and whether they received first @-@ line or later treatment .
no new toxicity signals were identified .
screening recommendations during pregnancy still apply , but the benefit of treatment is less certain .
the certainty of the recommendation to screen for and treat asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy has been softened from Grade A to Grade B .
the recommendation against screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in nonpregnant adults remains unchanged ( Grade D ) .
these recommendations are consistent with those of the Infectious Diseases Society of America ( Clin Infect Dis 2019 ; 68 : e83 ) .
while this decision is usually straightforward in the outpatient setting , the difficulty arises in a patient who cannot be easily assessed for symptoms .
in pregnant women , routine testing for asymptomatic bacteriuria continues to be recommended .
in a retrospective study , cardiovascular risk was lower with metformin than with sulfonylureas .
in 2016 , the FDA loosened restrictions on metformin use in patients with mild renal impairment .
during median follow @-@ up of roughly 1 year , incidence of major adverse CV events , including death , myocardial infarction , stroke , or transient ischemic attack , was significantly lower in metformin users than in sulfonylurea users ( 23.0 vs. 29.2 per 1000 person @-@ years ) .
this study provides further support for the relative safety of metformin in patients with declining renal function .
however , given the study design , we can 't say whether metformin protected against adverse CV events , whether sulfonylureas increased adverse CV event rates , or whether the difference reflected residual confounding despite multivariable matching .
in addition , we don 't know how sulfonylurea doses were managed in the face of declining renal function ; presumably , excessive sulfonylurea @-@ related hypoglycemia could predispose patients to adverse CV outcomes .
oral lefamulin performed as well as moxifloxacin but with considerably more gastrointestinal toxicity .
new antibiotics are a rarity these days , let alone new antibiotic classes .
but in August 2019 , the FDA approved lefamulin ( Xenleta ) , the first of the broad @-@ spectrum pleuromutilins , for treating patients with bacterial pneumonia .
in one of two industry @-@ sponsored , placebo @-@ controlled studies that led to the drug 's approval , investigators randomized 738 ambulatory patients ( mean age , 57 ) with community @-@ acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) to either oral lefamulin ( twice daily for 5 days ) or oral moxifloxacin ( daily for 7 days ) .
patients were recruited from 19 countries , primarily in Eastern Europe ; 40 % were smokers ; and most had comorbidities .
overall , the drugs performed equally well , with about 90 % of each group being clinically improved after 4 days and also after treatment cessation .
responses also were equally good for the subgroup in whom a bacterial pathogen was identified , including the very few patients with drug @-@ resistant pneumococcus or methicillin @-@ resistant Staphylococcus aureus .
lefamulin recipients were significantly more likely than moxifloxacin recipients to report gastrointestinal side effects ( 18 % vs. 8 % ) , most often diarrhea and vomiting .
too few patients were bacteremic to allow a good assessment of drug response among them .
a new antibiotic with activity against antibiotic @-@ resistant organisms certainly is welcome .
however , clinicians emphatically should not waste this one on routine cases of CAP .
the manufacturer ( Nabriva ) suggests that the mechanism of action of the pleuromutilins ( i.e. , they inhibit bacterial protein synthesis ) means they will be relatively slow to induce resistance .
Fortunately , it will be so much more expensive than the older alternatives ( > US $ 1000 wholesale for an oral course ) that presumably its use will be strictly controlled by insurers .
observational data have shown that slow advancement of enteral feeding volumes in preterm infants is associated with a reduced risk of necrotizing enterocolitis but an increased risk of late @-@ onset sepsis .
however , data from randomized trials are limited .
we randomly assigned very preterm or very @-@ low @-@ birth @-@ weight infants to daily milk increments of 30 ml per kilogram of body weight ( faster increment ) or 18 ml per kilogram ( slower increment ) until reaching full feeding volumes .
the primary outcome was survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months .
secondary outcomes included components of the primary outcome , confirmed or suspected late @-@ onset sepsis , necrotizing enterocolitis , and cerebral palsy .
among 2804 infants who underwent randomization , the primary outcome could be assessed in 1224 ( 87.4 % ) assigned to the faster increment and 1246 ( 88.7 % ) assigned to the slower increment .
survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months occurred in 802 of 1224 infants ( 65.5 % ) assigned to the faster increment and 848 of 1246 ( 68.1 % ) assigned to the slower increment ( adjusted risk ratio , 0.96 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.92 to 1.01 ; P = 0.16 ) .
late @-@ onset sepsis occurred in 414 of 1389 infants ( 29.8 % ) in the faster @-@ increment group and 434 of 1397 ( 31.1 % ) in the slower @-@ increment group ( adjusted risk ratio , 0.96 ; 95 % CI , 0.86 to 1.07 ) .
necrotizing enterocolitis occurred in 70 of 1394 infants ( 5.0 % ) in the faster @-@ increment group and 78 of 1399 ( 5.6 % ) in the slower @-@ increment group ( adjusted risk ratio , 0.88 ; 95 % CI , 0.68 to 1.16 ) .
there was no significant difference in survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months in very preterm or very @-@ low @-@ birth @-@ weight infants with a strategy of advancing milk feeding volumes in daily increments of 30 ml per kilogram as compared with 18 ml per kilogram . ( Funded by the Health Technology Assessment Programme of the National Institute for Health Research ; SIFT Current Controlled Trials number , ISRCTN76463425 . )
infants who are very preterm ( < 32 weeks of gestation ) or who have a very low birth weight ( < 1500 g ) are fed increasing volumes of milk per day until they reach full enteral feeding volumes .
the approach to increasing the feeding volume per day is uncertain because of competing concerns .
observational studies have shown a higher risk of necrotizing enterocolitis1 @-@ 3 with rapid advancement of feeding volumes but are subject to bias ; one was an uncontrolled study before and after the introduction of a slowly progressive tube @-@ feeding schedule , 1 and two were small case @-@ control studies.2,3
slower advances in feeding volume might , however , increase the risk of late @-@ onset sepsis from longer exposure to parenteral feeding , as shown in a meta @-@ analysis that also revealed no increase in necrotizing enterocolitis.4
these conditions are both major causes of death and illness , including adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes.5 @-@ 8
existing trial data are insufficient to determine whether advancing enteral feeding volumes slowly ( typically by < 24 ml per kilogram of body weight per day ) as compared with more quickly ( by 30 to 40 ml per kilogram per day ) affects outcomes of very preterm or very @-@ low @-@ birth @-@ weight infants.4,9 @-@ 16
the Speed of Increasing Milk Feeds Trial ( SIFT ) therefore compared faster ( 30 ml per kilogram ) with slower ( 18 ml per kilogram ) daily increments in milk feeding volumes .
trial DESIGN AND PROCEDURES
the trial was a multicenter , parallel @-@ group , randomized , controlled trial that followed a published protocol , 17 also available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org .
the trial was approved by the East Midlands National Research Ethics Committee and the National Maternity Hospital Ethics Committee in Dublin and overseen by independent steering and data and safety monitoring committees .
after written informed consent was obtained from parents , infants receiving less than 30 ml of milk per kilogram per day at randomization were eligible to participate if they were born before 32 weeks of gestation , had a birth weight of less than 1500 g , or both .
infants who had a known severe congenital anomaly or no realistic chance of survival or who were unlikely to be traceable for follow @-@ up were ineligible .
when clinicians were ready to start advancing feeding volumes , infants were randomly assigned to receive daily increments in feeding volume of 30 ml per kilogram ( faster increment ) or 18 ml per kilogram ( slower increment ) .
computerized randomization was performed through a secure website hosted by the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit Clinical Trials Unit , University of Oxford .
a minimization algorithm balanced prognostic factors : hospital , multiple birth , gestational age range ( Table 1 ) , and whether the birth weight was below the 10th percentile for gestational age .
infants from multiple births were assigned to the same treatment .
all other aspects of feeding and care followed routine clinical practice in the individual units , including the capacity to stop or alter the rate of increase in feeding volume if clinically indicated .
data were collected at trial entry , including whether the infant had absent or reversed end @-@ diastolic umbilical arterial blood flow identified on any antenatal ultrasonographic scan .
the primary outcome was survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months of age , corrected for gestational age at birth .
moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability was defined as any of the following : moderate or severe visual impairment ( reduced vision uncorrected with aids , blindness in one eye with good vision in the contralateral eye , or blindness or light perception only ) , moderate or severe hearing impairment ( hearing loss corrected with aids , some hearing loss uncorrected by aids , or deafness ) , moderate or severe gross motor impairment ( inability to walk or sit independently ) , or moderate or severe cognitive impairment as assessed with the use of the Parent Report of Children 's Abilities @-@ Revised ( PARCA @-@ R ) or clinical data if PARCA @-@ R scores were missing .
total PARCA @-@ R scores of less than 44 ( range , 0 to 158 , with lower scores indicating greater impairment ) were used to identify children with moderate or severe developmental impairment.18
secondary outcomes included death , death before discharge home , microbiologically confirmed or clinically suspected late @-@ onset sepsis from trial entry to discharge home , Bell 's stage 2 or 3 necrotizing enterocolitis ( stages range from 1 to 3 , with higher stages indicating greater severity of disease ) from trial entry to discharge home , time taken to reach full milk feeding volumes ( 150 ml per kilogram per day for 3 consecutive days ) , growth ( change in weight and head circumference z score for gestational age ) from birth to discharge home , duration of parenteral feeding , duration of time in intensive care , duration of hospital stay to discharge home , diagnosis of cerebral palsy by a doctor or other health professional , moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months ( corrected for gestational age ) , and the individual components of the definition of moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability .
classifications of moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability , late @-@ onset sepsis , and necrotizing enterocolitis were confirmed by an end @-@ point review committee whose members were unaware of the trial @-@ group assignments ; the committee used standard definitions if outcomes were ambiguous or data were missing ( see the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org ) .
all data @-@ collection forms were assessed independently by pairs of clinicians who were unaware of the trial @-@ group assignments .
owing to rounding of the feeding rate to the nearest 0.5 ml per kilogram or small changes in daily weight in the clinical setting , some infants receiving " full enteral feeding volumes " received only 145 to 149 ml per kilogram per day .
we therefore considered an infant to be receiving full enteral feeding volumes if at least 145 ml per kilogram per day was administered for 3 consecutive days .
cases that did not meet these criteria were reviewed by the end @-@ point review committee to determine whether a sustained level of feeding below this had been achieved .
examples of this included feeds being stopped during transfer or a procedure and use of higher @-@ calorie formula .
we estimated that 80 % of infants would survive to 2 years and that 11 % of survivors would have moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability.19
we anticipated that the primary outcome would occur in 71 % of the comparator ( slower @-@ increment ) group .
with a total sample size of 2500 and allowance for a questionnaire response rate of 80 % , there would be 90 % power to detect an absolute difference of 6.3 percentage points in the incidence of the primary outcome between the trial groups with a two @-@ sided significance level of 5 % .
similarly , enrollment of 2500 infants would provide the trial with 90 % power to detect an absolute difference of 5.4 percentage points ( from 25.0 % in the comparator group ) in the incidence of late @-@ onset sepsis20 and an absolute difference of 3.5 percentage points ( from 6.0 % in the comparator group ) in the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis ( Bell 's stage 2 or 3 ) .21 @-@ 23
subsequently , an inflation factor of 1.12 was applied to the sample size to allow for multiple births , since infants from a multiple birth received the same treatment and we anticipated correlated outcomes .
this adjustment assumed the percentage of multiple births to be 25 % and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.9 for the primary outcome at 24 months , corrected for gestational age.24
the total target sample size was therefore increased to 2800 .
demographic factors , clinical characteristics , and outcomes were summarized with counts and percentages for categorical variables , means and standard deviations for normally distributed continuous variables , and medians and interquartile or simple ranges for other continuous variables .
outcomes were analyzed on an intention @-@ to @-@ treat basis with the use of the slower @-@ increment group as the comparator .
risk ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated for the primary outcome at 24 months ( corrected for gestational age ) and for the discharge outcomes of late @-@ onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis .
we used 99 % confidence intervals for all other dichotomous outcomes , to take account of the number of hypothesis tests performed , without full adjustment for multiple testing .
for normally distributed continuous outcomes , the mean difference and 99 % confidence interval are presented ; for skewed continuous variables , the median difference and 99 % confidence interval are presented .
adjusted risk ratios were estimated with the use of log @-@ binomial regression , or log @-@ Poisson regression with a robust variance estimator if the binomial model failed to converge .
linear regression was used for normally distributed continuous variables , and quantile regression was used for skewed continuous variables .
the primary inference was based on the analysis with adjustment for the minimization factors at randomization .
center was fitted as a random effect , and the other minimization factors were fitted as fixed effects .
a unique identifier for each mother was nested within center to take account of the additional level of clustering due to multiple births and siblings .
this method facilitates the calculation of robust standard errors to allow for the lack of independence in trial @-@ group assignments and the potential correlation in outcome .
the consistency of the effects of advancing milk feeding volumes on the incidence of the primary outcome , late @-@ onset sepsis , and necrotizing enterocolitis across specific subgroups was assessed with the use of the statistical test of interaction .
prespecified subgroup analyses included week of gestation at birth , birth weight ( < 10th percentile for gestational age vs. ≥ 10th percentile ) , and type of milk received during the hospital stay ( breast milk only vs. formula only vs. both breast milk and formula ) .
post hoc analysis assessed the effect of the increments on late @-@ onset sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis in infants with absent or reversed end @-@ diastolic umbilical flow on antenatal Doppler ultrasonography .
other deviations from the protocol include the use of quantile regression instead of Cox regression to analyze the time to full feeding volumes ( because the Cox proportional @-@ hazards assumption was not satisfied ) and mixed @-@ effect log @-@ binomial or log @-@ Poisson models instead of generalized estimating equations ( owing to the ease and flexibility of these methods , which were not in common use when the trial was conceived ) .
we performed a sensitivity analysis to examine the effect of missing data at 24 months on the primary outcome , by considering different scenarios that departed from the assumption that data were missing completely at random .
a total of 2804 infants were recruited between June 8 , 2013 , and June 30 , 2015 , from 55 hospitals .
infant and maternal characteristics were similar in the two trial groups ( Table 1 , and Table S3A through S3C in the Supplementary Appendix ) .
all infants received the assigned intervention , but 69 discontinued the intervention , 66 owing to clinician or parental preference and 3 owing to transfer to a nonparticipating hospital ( Figure 1 ) .
for 11 infants , parental consent was withdrawn , and their data were not available for analysis .
the remainder were included in modified intention @-@ to @-@ treat analyses .
outcome data at discharge home were not available for 8 infants ; their data were included in the analyses , except when knowledge of discharge or the date of discharge was required .
a total of 68 infants in the faster @-@ increment group and 77 in the slower @-@ increment group died before 24 months , corrected for gestational age ( Table 2 ) .
assessment of the primary outcome at 24 months , corrected for gestational age , was possible in 1224 infants ( 87.4 % ) in the faster @-@ increment group and 1246 ( 88.7 % ) in the slower @-@ increment group ( Figure 1 ) .
primary AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES AT 24 MONTHS OF AGE , CORRECTED FOR PREMATURITY
at 24 months ( corrected for gestational age ) , death had occurred in 68 of 1224 infants ( 5.6 % ) in the faster @-@ increment group and in 77 of 1246 ( 6.2 % ) in the slower @-@ increment group , and moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability had occurred in 354 infants in the faster @-@ increment group and in 321 in the slower @-@ increment group ( Table 2 ) .
there was no significant difference between infants receiving a faster daily increment ( 30 ml per kilogram ) and those receiving a slower daily increment ( 18 ml per kilogram ) regarding the primary outcome of survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months , corrected for gestational age ( Table 2 ) .
there were also no significant differences between the faster @-@ increment group and the slower @-@ increment group regarding the individual components of the composite outcome .
the results were similar in sensitivity analyses of missing data that used different approaches to impute missing data ( Table S5B ) .
the faster @-@ increment group reached full milk feeding volumes at a median of 7 days , as compared with 10 days in the slower @-@ increment group ( adjusted median difference , − 2.7 days ; 99 % confidence interval [ CI ] , − 3.1 to − 2.4 ) ; the duration of parenteral nutrition from trial entry to discharge home was 9 days and 11 days , respectively ( adjusted median difference , − 2.2 days ; 99 % CI , − 2.7 to − 1.6 ) ( Table 3 ) .
there was no evidence of significant between @-@ group differences regarding confirmed or clinically suspected late @-@ onset sepsis , Bell 's stage 2 or 3 necrotizing enterocolitis , death during hospitalization , weight and head circumference standard @-@ deviation scores at discharge , duration of time in intensive care , and duration of hospital stay from trial entry ( Table 3 ) .
there was weak evidence of statistical interaction between the type of milk ( breast milk only , formula only , or both breast milk and formula ) and feeding increment with respect to survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months , corrected for gestational age ( P = 0.045 ) .
for infants fed with formula only , survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability was seen in 12 of 30 infants ( 40 % ) in the faster @-@ increment group , as compared with 28 of 40 ( 70 % ) in the slower @-@ increment group ( Figure 2 and Table S5C ) .
post hoc analysis did not show an interaction between antenatal absent or reversed end @-@ diastolic umbilical flow and faster or slower feeding increments ( Tables S1 and S2 ) .
four serious adverse events that were not prespecified as outcomes were reported .
one infant in each group had an intracardiac thrombus , with one of these extending into the superior vena cava and causing renal failure and death ( faster @-@ increment group ) .
one infant ( in the faster @-@ increment group ) had conjugated hyperbilirubinemia , which resolved , and one infant ( in the slower @-@ increment group ) became dehydrated briefly with extravasation from a central venous catheter .
in this large , pragmatic , randomized , controlled trial involving infants with a gestational age of less than 32 weeks or a birth weight of less than 1500 g , advancing milk feeding volumes at daily increments of 30 ml per kilogram as compared with 18 ml per kilogram did not affect survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability at 24 months , corrected for gestational age .
the speed of increment in feeding volumes also did not affect the risks of late @-@ onset sepsis , necrotizing enterocolitis , or death during hospitalization .
secondary @-@ outcome analysis suggested that the number of days to reach full milk feeding volumes and the number of days of parenteral nutrition were lower with faster increments than with slower increments .
although these feeding outcomes seem to favor faster increments , the risk of moderate or severe motor impairment was unexpectedly higher in the faster @-@ increment group than in the slower @-@ increment group .
this observation is unexplained , and there were not more cases of late @-@ onset sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis in the faster @-@ increment group .
it is possible that it is a chance finding , since it was one of multiple secondary outcomes assessed , but biologically plausible explanations include increased cardiorespiratory events from pressure on the diaphragm or inability to absorb enteral nutrition .
the trial was pragmatic , and , apart from daily increments in milk volume , clinician preference and unit guidelines determined other care .
the primary outcome could be assessed in 87.4 % of the infants in the faster @-@ increment group and in 88.7 % of those in the slower @-@ increment group at 24 months , corrected for gestational age .
similar results were obtained from sensitivity analyses with imputation of missing data .
as compared with previous trials , 9 @-@ 16 the present trial included larger numbers of high @-@ risk infants , including 1020 extremely low @-@ birth @-@ weight infants ( < 1000 g ) , 994 extremely preterm infants ( < 28 weeks of gestation ) , and 435 infants with absent or reversed end @-@ diastolic umbilical flow on antenatal Doppler studies .
subgroup analyses of higher @-@ risk infants were reassuring , because there was no suggestion of worse outcomes with faster increments than with slower increments .
infants were a median of 4 days old at commencement of the intervention , and therefore the trial does not inform the relative safety of these feeding volume increments in the first few days after birth .
further study would be needed to address enteral feeding in these infants , other speeds of advancing feeding volumes , and different milks .
infants born at extremely early gestational ages or with an extremely low birth weight may react differently than other infants to the speed of increasing feeding volumes .
we did not find appreciable differences in outcome according to these variables , but our trial included relatively small numbers of infants in these categories , and further research may be warranted in these groups .
observational data have suggested a reduced risk of necrotizing enterocolitis among very preterm or very @-@ low @-@ birth @-@ weight infants fed breast milk.26
most participating infants in SIFT were fed , at least partially , with breast milk .
only 2.8 % of the infants who were followed to 24 months were fed formula alone , with similar numbers in the two groups .
with respect to these formula @-@ only infants , the finding of a poorer outcome in the faster @-@ increment group than in the slower @-@ increment group probably represents a chance finding , given the small numbers of infants , substantial loss to follow @-@ up , and multiple comparisons performed without adjustment for multiple testing .
the risk @-@ benefit balance of enteral @-@ feeding strategies may differ between human milk @-@ fed infants and formula @-@ fed infants .
the trial was unblinded , because it was considered impractical for caregivers and parents to be unaware of the trial @-@ group assignments .
this is unlikely to have influenced the ascertainment of the most important outcomes , which were reviewed by end @-@ point review committees whose members were unaware of the trial @-@ group assignments .
although it is possible that knowledge of the trial @-@ group assignments could alter clinician practice ( e.g. , preferentially stopping feeds given at faster rather than slower increments in cases of suspected necrotizing enterocolitis ) , this is unlikely to have substantively affected the results .
in conclusion , the speed of advancing enteral feeding volumes - daily increments of 30 ml per kilogram as compared with 18 ml per kilogram - did not have a significant effect on the primary outcome of survival without moderate or severe neurodevelopmental disability , nor did it affect the risks of late @-@ onset sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis in very preterm or very @-@ low @-@ birth @-@ weight infants .
identifying mechanisms of diseases with complex inheritance patterns , such as macular telangiectasia type 2 , is challenging .
a link between macular telangiectasia type 2 and altered serine metabolism has been established previously .
through exome sequence analysis of a patient with macular telangiectasia type 2 and his family members , we identified a variant in SPTLC1 encoding a subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase ( SPT ) .
because mutations affecting SPT are known to cause hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 ( HSAN1 ) , we examined 10 additional persons with HSAN1 for ophthalmologic disease .
we assayed serum amino acid and sphingoid base levels , including levels of deoxysphingolipids , in patients who had macular telangiectasia type 2 but did not have HSAN1 or pathogenic variants affecting SPT .
we characterized mice with low serine levels and tested the effects of deoxysphingolipids on human retinal organoids .
two variants known to cause HSAN1 were identified as causal for macular telangiectasia type 2 : of 11 patients with HSAN1 , 9 also had macular telangiectasia type 2 .
circulating deoxysphingolipid levels were 84.2 % higher among 125 patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 who did not have pathogenic variants affecting SPT than among 94 unaffected controls .
deoxysphingolipid levels were negatively correlated with serine levels , which were 20.6 % lower than among controls .
reduction of serine levels in mice led to increases in levels of retinal deoxysphingolipids and compromised visual function .
deoxysphingolipids caused photoreceptor @-@ cell death in retinal organoids , but not in the presence of regulators of lipid metabolism .
elevated levels of atypical deoxysphingolipids , caused by variant SPTLC1 or SPTLC2 or by low serine levels , were risk factors for macular telangiectasia type 2 , as well as for peripheral neuropathy . ( Funded by the Lowy Medical Research Institute and others . )
understanding the pathophysiology of diseases with complex genetic inheritance patterns is challenging .
macular telangiectasia type 2 , which has a prevalence of 0.0045 % to 0.06 % , is a rare macular disease that leads to loss of central vision , with the onset of symptoms occurring in the fifth or sixth decade of life.1 @-@ 4
the condition has a strong genetic component , as evidenced by extended families having multiple affected family members.5
however , the inheritance pattern is not clear because of the variable penetrance and expressivity of the disease.6,7
recent insights into macular telangiectasia type 2 have come from genomewide association and metabolomic studies , which have suggested that it is associated with low serine levels in blood.8
serine is a substrate in numerous metabolic pathways , including protein , nucleotide , and lipid synthesis .
whether and how low levels of serine affect macular health is unknown .
serine palmitoyltransferase ( SPT ) condenses serine and palmitoyl @-@ CoA and is the rate @-@ limiting enzyme in sphingolipid synthesis.9
variants in the genes SPTLC1 and SPTLC2 , encoding two SPT subunits , result in the increased synthesis of atypical deoxysphingolipids and are causative for the rare disorder hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 ( HSAN1 ) .10 @-@ 12
deoxysphingolipids are toxic to multiple cell types , especially neurons.10,13 @-@ 17
in vitro studies have shown that deoxysphingolipids can also accumulate in the absence of mutations in SPTLC1 or SPTLC2 when levels of serine are low.18
in this study , we investigated the role of deoxysphingolipids in macular telangiectasia type 2 and examined how a metabolic defect might lead to disease in both the eye and the peripheral nervous system .
study PARTICIPANTS AND GENETIC ANALYSES
we enrolled patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 , HSAN1 , or both conditions , as well as available family members and unaffected controls ; all participants provided written informed consent , and the study was approved by local institutional review boards .
clinical diagnoses were confirmed by experienced retina specialists at the Moorfields Eye Hospital Reading Centre who were not aware of previous diagnoses .
genomic DNA from patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 and their family members was analyzed by exome sequencing .
exome sequence was captured with SeqCap EZ Exome , version 3 .
raw sequence data were quality filtered with CASAVA ( Illumina ) and aligned to the Human Reference Genome , build hg19 .

linear mixed models controlling for covariates with a significant effect on metabolite levels in plasma were used to assess differences in these levels between unaffected persons and persons with macular telangiectasia type 2 .
for all experiments , P values from tests performed on the same data set were corrected for multiple testing by the Benjamini @-@ Hochberg procedure .
the regression coefficient b represents the magnitude of the effect . ( additional details of the statistical analysis , as well as details of the experiments conducted in mice and cell culture , are provided in Supplementary Appendix 1 , available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. )
HSAN1 AND SUSCEPTIBILITY TO MACULAR TELANGIECTASIA TYPE 2
a 21 @-@ year @-@ old man ( Family Member III @-@ 3 [ Family 1 ] in Figure 1 and Table 1 ) presented with bull 's @-@ eye maculopathy in both eyes .
clinical examination revealed findings diagnostic for macular telangiectasia type 2 , including parafoveal telangiectatic retinal vessels , " right angle " venules , retinal opacification , pigment clumping , low levels of macular carotenoid pigment , late and mild leakage on fluorescein angiography , blue light @-@ reflectance abnormalities , and intraretinal cysts and ellipsoid zone defects on optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) .
his parents and both siblings were then examined , which led to a diagnosis of macular telangiectasia type 2 in the father ( II @-@ 2 ) .
one sister ( III @-@ 2 ) was described as " possibly affected " because of reduced macular pigment and subtle parafoveal leakage as revealed by late @-@ phase fluorescein angiography .
the other sister ( III @-@ 1 ) was not affected .
the proband and his father and possibly affected sister reported having a familial peripheral neuropathy that had been diagnosed as Charcot @-@ Marie @-@ Tooth disease .
exome sequencing revealed that these family members had the p.Cys133Tyr mutation in SPTLC1 ( variant NM _ 006415.3 [ SPTLC1 ] : c.398G → A ; genomic location , 9 : 92080045 [ GRCh38 ] ; ClinVar accession number , VCV000004800.1 ) , 20 which is diagnostic of the rare disorder hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1A ( HSAN1A ) .20
the variant is pathogenic according to American College of Medical Genetics criteria for causality21 and cosegregated with both macular telangiectasia type 2 and HSAN1A in this family ( Figure 1B ) .
six patients carried the p.Cys133Tyr mutation , two carried the p.Cys133Trp mutation in SPTLC1 , and two carried the p.Ser384Phe mutation in SPTLC2 , a variant previously shown to result in increased deoxysphingolipid levels and to cause HSAN1C , a disease closely related to HSAN1A ( Table 1 ) .22
macular telangiectasia type 2 is an orphan disease , affecting approximately 1 in 5000 persons.3,4
we observed macular telangiectasia type 2 in 9 of the 13 patients with HSAN1 we examined ( P = 2.2 × 10 − 16 by one @-@ sided binomial test ) .
of the remaining 4 patients with HSAN1 , 2 had abnormal macular features ( III @-@ 2 in Family 1 ) or macular telangiectasia type 2 @-@ associated changes ( III @-@ 2 in Family 1 and III @-@ 2 in Family 2 ) .
all 4 patients were younger than 50 years of age and were too young for a definitive diagnosis ; they were also taking serine supplements , which may delay disease onset .
the macular telangiectasia type 2 phenotype observed in the patients with HSAN1 was typical of that observed in the patients without HSAN1 .
we further characterized 6 patients with HSAN1 ( including those graded as unaffected or possibly affected ) with the use of FLIO .
the two patients with HSAN1A who had the SPTLC1 p.Cys133Trp variant ( Patient 2 and Patient 3 ) , which is also associated with high deoxysphingolipid levels , 18 were designated as not affected with macular telangiectasia type 2 .
both patients were younger than 50 years of age .
deoxysphingolipid LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH MACULAR TELANGIECTASIA TYPE 2
although the majority of patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 do not have a pathogenic variant affecting either subunit of SPT , they have lower levels of serine in serum than do unaffected controls.8
under low @-@ serine conditions , alanine incorporation by SPT is increased , which results in the generation of deoxysphingolipids that lack the hydroxyl moiety critical for synthesis and degradation of more complex sphingolipids ( Figure 2A ) .9,23
to determine whether deoxysphingolipid levels are elevated in patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 , we assayed amino acids and total hydrolyzed sphingoid bases in serum specimens from 125 nonconsanguineous patients with the condition and 94 unaffected controls ( Table S1 in Supplementary Appendix 1 ) .
we had previously sequenced the exomes of these patients and found no pathogenic variants in SPTLC1 or SPTLC2 .
we used linear mixed models to assess whether there were differences in metabolite levels between patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 and unaffected controls .
the effect of available covariates ( ethnic group , sex at birth , age , collection site , and diabetes status ) was estimated , and only significant covariates were included in the final model .
we detected no significant differences in levels of sphinganine ( b = 0.043 , P = 0.476 ) but found that levels of serum deoxysphinganine were , on average , 84.2 % higher in the cohort with macular telangiectasia type 2 ( b = 0.611 , P = 1.04 × 10 − 10 ) , indicating that levels of these toxic lipids are elevated in the broader ( non @-@ HSAN1 ) population of patients with the condition ( Figure 2B and 2C ; the data set for the graphs shown in Figure 2 are provided in Supplementary Appendix 2 , available at NEJM.org ) .
to address whether deoxysphingolipid levels correlated with disease severity , we analyzed the relationship between deoxysphingolipid levels and a quantifiable anatomical abnormality , loss of the ellipsoid zone ( representing a break in the OCT reflectance pattern ) .
the extent of loss is known to correlate with function as assessed by microperimetry24 @-@ 27 and hence can be used as a measure of disease progression .
we found a positive relationship between ellipsoid @-@ zone loss and deoxysphinganine levels in the 125 patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 ( b = 0.148 ; 95 % confidence interval , 0.004 to 0.299 ) . ( additional details of these analyses are provided in Tables S2 through S6 , S9 , and S10 in Supplementary Appendix 1 . )
elevated deoxysphinganine levels have been reported in patients with type 2 diabetes , 13,28 and patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes than the general population.29
we therefore evaluated the relationship among these two conditions and deoxysphinganine levels .
we found that deoxysphinganine levels were not significantly higher in patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 who had type 2 diabetes than in those who did not have type 2 diabetes ( b = 0.328 , P = 0.07 ) ( Table S5 in Supplementary Appendix 1 ) .
among persons who did not have macular telangiectasia type 2 , levels did not differ significantly between those who had type 2 diabetes and those who did not ( b = − 0.116 , P = 0.46 ) .
when patients with type 2 diabetes were excluded from the entire group , levels of deoxysphinganine were higher among patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 than among unaffected controls ( b = 0.516 , P = 9.3 × 10 − 7 ) , which suggests that the elevation in deoxysphinganine levels in patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 is not driven by the greater number of patients with type 2 diabetes in this group ( Table S1 in Supplementary Appendix 1 ) .
consistent with our previous findings , 8 serine levels were significantly lower in serum specimens from patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 than among controls , by 20.6 % on average ( b = − 0.231 , P = 6.63 × 10 − 10 ) ( Figure 2D ) .
in addition , levels of deoxysphinganine showed the strongest correlations with levels of plasma serine ( b = − 1.27 , P = 5.55 × 10 − 18 ) and alanine ( b = 0.63 , P = 7.59 × 10 − 5 ) ( Figure 2E and 2F ) , associations that remained significant when we controlled for other covariates and macular telangiectasia type 2 status .
patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 had total deoxysphinganine levels that were similar to , and in some cases higher than , those of patients with HSAN1 , which suggested that reduced serine levels are sufficient to increase deoxysphinganine to disease @-@ associated levels .
these results show that reduced levels of circulating serine , regardless of the cause , result in accumulation of deoxysphinganine in serum in patients . ( additional details of these analyses are provided in Tables S6 through S10 and Figure S2A in Supplementary Appendix 1 . )
by comparing levels of free deoxysphinganine with levels of hydrolyzed deoxysphinganine ( the sum of free deoxysphinganine plus deoxydihydroceramide ) , we found that nearly 90 % of the pool of deoxysphinganines was derived from deoxydihydroceramide .
when we measured the deoxysphinganine levels in fractionated serum we found that , similar to other sphingolipids , 30 deoxysphinganines were complexed with the low- and very @-@ low @-@ density lipoproteins , which suggests that the liver is the primary source of circulating deoxysphingolipids .
low SERINE LEVELS IN A MOUSE MODEL
we next tested whether low levels of circulating serine ( macular telangiectasia type 2 phenotype ) would be sufficient to increase tissue deoxysphingolipid levels .
we fed 8 @-@ week @-@ old male mice an isocaloric and isonitrogenous control diet or a diet that was depleted of serine and glycine ( depletion of glycine prevents its compensatory conversion to serine31 ) .
mice that were fed a serine- and glycine @-@ free diet had lower serine levels throughout the day than did those that were fed the control diet ( P = 9.3 × 10 − 14 ) ( Figure 3A ) .
the mice with low circulating serine levels had deoxysphinganine levels that were 3 times as high as those in the mice that were fed the control diet ( P = 0.002 ) and had no change in sphinganine levels ( Figure 3B ) .
we found a negative correlation between serine levels and deoxysphinganine levels ( r = − 0.803 ) .
the retina and retinal pigment epithelium from mice that were fed the serine- and glycine @-@ free diet also had elevated deoxysphinganine levels ( P < 0.001 and P = 0.006 , respectively ) ( Figure 3C and 3D ) .
we examined the sciatic nerve and found a similar elevation in deoxysphinganine relative to the nerve in control mice ( P = 0.04 ) ( Figure 3E ) .
the ratio of deoxysphinganine to sphinganine was also elevated in the plasma and tissues . ( additional details of these analyses are provided in Figure S3 in Supplementary Appendix 1 . )
retinal and peripheral sensory deficits developed in mice that were fed the serine- and glycine @-@ free diet for 10 months .
similar to a mouse model of HSAN1 in which mutant SPTLC1 was overexpressed , 12 mice that were fed the depleted diet also had an elevated thermal latency threshold ( P = 0.005 ) ( Figure 3I ) .
a reduction in serine and glycine levels in plasma is sufficient to increase plasma and tissue levels of deoxysphingolipids and causes functional retinal and peripheral sensory deficits .
retinal TOXICITY OF DEOXYDIHYDROCERAMIDE
a characteristic late @-@ stage manifestation of macular telangiectasia type 2 is the loss of photoreceptors in the macula32 ; this process can be modeled in vitro with human induced pluripotent stem cell @-@ derived retinal organoids , which are stratified retinal tissues containing most of the major neural retinal cell types , including functional photoreceptors and Müller glia ( Figure 4A ) .33
in contrast , toxic effects were not observed when organoids were treated with two distinct deoxysphingosine species.34
inhibition of ceramide synthase with fumonisin B1 prevented deoxysphinganine @-@ induced cell death ( P = 6 × 10 − 16 ) ( Figure 4C and 4D ) , indicating that the toxic effects were due to one or both of its downstream products , deoxydihydroceramide and deoxyceramide ( Figure 4D ) .
to distinguish between these , we quantified ceramide species after treatment with deoxysphinganine , sphinganine , sphingosine , or either species of deoxysphingosine and found that only the levels of deoxydihydroceramide correlated with toxicity . ( additional details of these analyses are provided in Figures S5 through S7 in Supplementary Appendix 1 . )
fenofibrate AND DEOXYSPHINGOLIPID @-@ INDUCED RETINAL TOXICITY
we sought to ameliorate the toxic effects of deoxydihydroceramide with the use of the peroxisome proliferator @-@ activated receptor a ( PPAR @-@ a ) agonist fenofibrate ( Figure 4D ) .
fenofibrate has been shown to stimulate degradation of deoxysphingolipids in a human embryonic kidney cell line and has been used to reduce deoxysphinganine levels in patients with dyslipidemia.35,36
we found that concurrent treatment of retinal organoids with fenofibrate at a concentration of 20 μmol per liter decreased deoxysphinganine @-@ induced cell death in photoreceptors by approximately 80 % ( P = 1.85 × 10 − 13 ) ( Figure 4A and 4C ) .
in addition to finding that altered amino acid and sphingolipid metabolism were the basis of the photoreceptor loss in patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 , we have expanded the definition of diseases caused by variants in SPTLC1 or SPTLC2 and have shown a link between abnormal systemic serine metabolism and tissue @-@ specific disease .
HSAN1 @-@ associated variants in these genes lead to pathologic accumulation of deoxysphinganine ; our data show that these mutations also cause macular telangiectasia type 2 .
the vast majority of patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 do not have variants in SPTLC1 or SPTLC2 , but these patients do have low serine levels and elevated deoxysphingolipid levels .
reducing circulating serine in mice is sufficient to increase deoxysphingolipid levels and cause functional defects in the retina and peripheral nerves .
we therefore conclude that elevated deoxysphingolipid levels can cause macular disease in the broader population of patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 , as well as in patients with HSAN1 .
we do not know why serine levels are systemically low in patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 .
given that serine is central to numerous metabolic pathways , the genetic regulators are probably diverse .
a genomewide association study identified loci associated with the condition within or near two of the three genes involved in de novo serine synthesis - PHGDH and PSPH8 - which supports speculation that perhaps serine synthesis is impaired in some patients .
perhaps , as well , some patients have elevated levels of deoxysphingolipids because of high alanine levels or impaired lipid degradation .
the multiple means of regulating serine and deoxysphingolipid levels may reflect the genetic heterogeneity observed in macular telangiectasia type 2 .
variations in environmental factors , such as diet , could also explain the variable penetrance of macular telangiectasia type 2 in families .
although elevated levels of deoxysphingolipids are known to be cytotoxic , 10,13,28,37 the mechanism of their toxicity is not fully understood .
deoxysphingolipids have been reported to disrupt mitochondrial function.16
further work is needed to understand the mechanism of retinal toxicity and the potential involvement of other sphingolipid metabolites .
although deoxysphinganine accumulation is observed systemically , it is not clear why the macular region of the retina and the extremities of the somatosensory nervous system are preferentially affected , but their unique metabolic demands could make them particularly vulnerable .
abnormal serine metabolism , leading to increased levels of deoxysphingolipids , may represent a broader " serineopathy " class of diseases that includes both retinal and peripheral neuropathies , and so it might be expected that patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 would also be at risk for peripheral neuropathies .
elevated deoxysphingolipid levels have been reported in patients with diabetes and may contribute to diabetic retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy , 28 which are common complications of diabetes .
although deoxysphingolipid levels can be reduced by systemically administering serine or fenofibrate , 18,36 we caution against prescribing serine or fenofibrate to patients with macular telangiectasia type 2 , given the complex genetic etiology of the condition and the genetic diversity in the patient population .
we have used a detailed patient registry , genetic and metabolomic analyses , and mouse and organoid models to uncover a link among macular telangiectasia type 2 , HSAN1 , and deoxysphingolipids .
in so doing , we established a connection between central and peripheral neuropathies , as well as between plasma amino acid levels and these disorders .
in patients with ST @-@ segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) of the culprit lesion reduces the risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction .
whether PCI of nonculprit lesions further reduces the risk of such events is unclear .
we randomly assigned patients with STEMI and multivessel coronary artery disease who had undergone successful culprit @-@ lesion PCI to a strategy of either complete revascularization with PCI of angiographically significant nonculprit lesions or no further revascularization .
randomization was stratified according to the intended timing of nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI ( either during or after the index hospitalization ) .
the first coprimary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction ; the second coprimary outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , or ischemia @-@ driven revascularization .
at a median follow @-@ up of 3 years , the first coprimary outcome had occurred in 158 of the 2016 patients ( 7.8 % ) in the complete @-@ revascularization group as compared with 213 of the 2025 patients ( 10.5 % ) in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group ( hazard ratio , 0.74 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.60 to 0.91 ; P = 0.004 ) .
the second coprimary outcome had occurred in 179 patients ( 8.9 % ) in the complete @-@ revascularization group as compared with 339 patients ( 16.7 % ) in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group ( hazard ratio , 0.51 ; 95 % CI , 0.43 to 0.61 ; P < 0.001 ) .
for both coprimary outcomes , the benefit of complete revascularization was consistently observed regardless of the intended timing of nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI ( P = 0.62 and P = 0.27 for interaction for the first and second coprimary outcomes , respectively ) .
among patients with STEMI and multivessel coronary artery disease , complete revascularization was superior to culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI in reducing the risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction , as well as the risk of cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , or ischemia @-@ driven revascularization . ( Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and others ; COMPLETE ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT01740479 . )
primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) is the preferred method of reperfusion for patients with ST @-@ segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) .1 @-@ 4
these patients often have multivessel coronary artery disease , with additional angiographically significant lesions in locations separate from that of the culprit lesion that caused the acute event.5
whether to routinely revascularize these nonculprit lesions or to manage them conservatively with guideline @-@ based medical therapy alone is a common dilemma.6 @-@ 8
nonculprit lesions , which are usually discovered incidentally at the time of primary PCI , may represent stable coronary artery plaques , for which additional revascularization may not offer additional benefit.9
however , if nonculprit lesions have morphologic features consistent with unstable plaques , which confer an increased risk of future cardiovascular events , there may be a benefit of routine nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI.10,11
although observational studies have suggested a possible reduction in clinical events with staged nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI , 12,13 these studies are limited by selection bias and confounding .
randomized trials have shown reductions in the risk of composite outcomes with nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI , with results driven predominantly by the decreased risk of subsequent revascularization with that strategy.14 @-@ 17
meta @-@ analyses suggest a reduction in the risk of death from cardiovascular causes or myocardial infarction with nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI , 18 @-@ 20 but previous individual trials have not had the power to examine this clinically important outcome .
the Complete versus Culprit @-@ Only Revascularization Strategies to Treat Multivessel Disease after Early PCI for STEMI ( COMPLETE ) trial was designed to address this evidence gap .
the COMPLETE trial was a multinational , randomized trial that evaluated a strategy of complete revascularization ( consisting of PCI of all suitable nonculprit lesions ) as compared with a strategy of no further revascularization in patients with STEMI and multivessel coronary artery disease who had undergone successful culprit @-@ lesion PCI.21
the executive committee designed the protocol , which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org , and was responsible for the conduct and oversight of the trial .
the trial was coordinated and sponsored by the Population Health Research Institute of Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster University .
the trial was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research .
AstraZeneca and Boston Scientific provided additional funding .
these companies had no role in the trial design ; collection , analysis , or interpretation of the data ; or writing of the manuscript .
the protocol was approved by institutional review boards at all trial centers .
the authors vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol .
patients who presented to the hospital with STEMI were considered for inclusion in the trial if they could undergo randomization within 72 hours after successful culprit @-@ lesion PCI .
eligible patients were required to have multivessel coronary artery disease , defined as the presence of at least one angiographically significant non @-@ infarct @-@ related ( nonculprit ) lesion that was amenable to successful treatment with PCI and was located in a vessel with a diameter of at least 2.5 mm that was not stented as part of the index culprit @-@ lesion PCI .
nonculprit lesions were deemed angiographically significant if they were associated with at least 70 % stenosis of the vessel diameter on visual estimation or with 50 to 69 % stenosis accompanied by a fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) measurement of 0.80 or less .
the main exclusion criteria were an intention before randomization to revascularize a nonculprit lesion , a planned surgical revascularization , or previous coronary @-@ artery bypass grafting surgery .
details regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org .
written informed consent was obtained from all the patients .
randomization AND TRIAL TREATMENTS
eligible patients were randomly assigned to undergo either complete revascularization or culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only revascularization according to a computer @-@ generated randomization list with the use of randomly permuted blocks and with blinding to trial center .
randomization was stratified according to center and the intended timing of nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI ( if the patient were to be assigned to the complete @-@ revascularization group ) .
randomization was performed as soon as possible ( no later than 72 hours ) after the index PCI .
patients who were randomly assigned to the complete @-@ revascularization strategy were to have routine staged PCI ( i.e. , PCI during a procedure separate from the index PCI procedure for STEMI ) of all suitable nonculprit lesions , regardless of whether there were clinical symptoms or there was evidence of ischemia .
investigators specified before randomization whether they intended to perform nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI during the index hospitalization or after hospital discharge ( no later than 45 days after randomization ) .
everolimus @-@ eluting stents were strongly recommended for all PCI procedures .
it was recommended that PCI of chronic total occlusions be attempted only by operators who had experience in treating chronic total occlusions and only when there was a high likelihood of successful PCI .
patients who were randomly assigned to the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI strategy received guideline @-@ based medical therapy with no further revascularization , regardless of whether there was evidence of ischemia on noninvasive testing .
protocol @-@ specified criteria for crossover to the complete @-@ revascularization strategy are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .
all coronary angiograms obtained during the trial were forwarded to an angiographic core laboratory located at the Population Health Research Institute for detailed assessment.21
after initial hospital discharge , routine follow @-@ up occurred at 6 weeks , 6 months , 1 year , and yearly thereafter up to the final follow @-@ up visit .
recommended MEDICAL THERAPY
guideline @-@ based medical therapy was recommended in both treatment groups .
dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor for at least 1 year was recommended.22
beyond 1 year , aspirin was recommended for all patients , and ticagrelor ( 60 mg twice daily ) was recommended for patients who were not at high risk for bleeding.23
high @-@ dose statin therapy , angiotensin @-@ converting @-@ enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin @-@ receptor blockers , mineralocorticoid @-@ receptor antagonists , and beta @-@ blockers were recommended.21
the first coprimary outcome was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes or new myocardial infarction ; the second coprimary outcome was the composite of death from cardiovascular causes , new myocardial infarction , or ischemia @-@ driven revascularization .
safety outcomes included major bleeding and contrast @-@ associated acute kidney injury .
secondary outcomes are described in the Supplementary Appendix ; detailed definitions of all outcomes are provided in Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix .
myocardial infarction was defined according to the third universal definition and was subclassified according to type.24
an event @-@ adjudication committee , which consisted of clinicians who were unaware of the treatment assignments , adjudicated primary , secondary , and safety outcome events .
we estimated that a sample of 4000 patients would give the trial 80 % power to detect a 22 % lower risk of the composite of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction in the complete @-@ revascularization group than in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group , assuming an event rate of 5 % per year in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group .
because a very conservative monitoring boundary was used for this analysis , no adjustment of the type I error threshold was applied .
details regarding these analyses are provided in the Supplementary Appendix .
all patients who underwent randomization were included in the analysis according to the treatment group to which they were assigned , regardless of the treatment they actually received ( intention @-@ to @-@ treat principle ) .
the coprimary outcomes were analyzed with the use of a time @-@ to @-@ first @-@ event approach .
estimates of the hazard ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated with the use of Cox proportional @-@ hazards models , with treatment group as an independent variable and with stratification according to the intended timing of nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI .
confidence intervals for secondary and exploratory efficacy outcomes have not been adjusted for multiple comparisons , and therefore inferences drawn from these intervals may not be reproducible .
the two treatment groups were compared with the use of the stratified log @-@ rank test .
cumulative incidence was estimated with the Kaplan @-@ Meier method .
a sensitivity analysis was performed with a Fine @-@ Gray model to account for the competing risk of death from noncardiovascular causes.25
patients , TREATMENT , AND FOLLOW @-@ UP
from February 1 , 2013 , through March 6 , 2017 , a total of 4041 patients from 140 centers in 31 countries underwent randomization : 2016 were assigned to the complete @-@ revascularization group and 2025 to the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group .
baseline and procedural characteristics are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 , respectively .
details are provided in Table S3 and Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix .
among the patients who underwent complete revascularization , the median time from randomization to nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI was 1 day ( interquartile range , 1 to 3 ) among the 1285 patients for whom the intended timing of nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI was during the index hospitalization and 23 days ( interquartile range , 12.5 to 33.5 ) among the 596 patients for whom the intended timing of nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI was after hospital discharge .
within the first 45 days , crossover from the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group to the complete @-@ revascularization group occurred in 96 patients ( 4.7 % ) , and crossover from the complete @-@ revascularization group to the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group occurred in 78 patients ( 3.9 % ) .
after nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI , 90.1 % of the patients in the complete @-@ revascularization group had a SYNTAX ( Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery ) score of 0 , indicating no angiographically significant disease ( i.e. , complete revascularization ) .
outcome events were assessed up to the date of each patient 's final follow @-@ up visit , which ranged from September 1 , 2018 , to June 7 , 2019 , when the database was locked .
the mean follow @-@ up time was 36.2 months , and the median follow @-@ up time was 35.8 months ( interquartile range , 27.6 to 44.3 ) .
data on vital status were complete for 99.1 % and 99.3 % of the patients in the complete @-@ revascularization and culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI groups , respectively .
data on concomitant medication use at hospital discharge and throughout follow @-@ up are provided in Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix .
at a median follow @-@ up of 3 years , death from cardiovascular causes or new myocardial infarction ( the first coprimary composite outcome ) had occurred in 158 patients ( 7.8 % ) in the complete @-@ revascularization group as compared with 213 patients ( 10.5 % ) in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group ( hazard ratio , 0.74 ; 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , 0.60 to 0.91 ; P = 0.004 ) ( Table 3 and Figure 1A ) .
this result was driven by the lower incidence of new myocardial infarction in the complete @-@ revascularization group than in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group ( 5.4 % vs. 7.9 % ; hazard ratio , 0.68 ; 95 % CI , 0.53 to 0.86 ) ; the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes was 2.9 % and 3.2 % , respectively ( hazard ratio , 0.93 ; 95 % CI , 0.65 to 1.32 ) .
specifically , the following types of myocardial infarction occurred less frequently in the complete @-@ revascularization group than in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group : non @-@ STEMI ( 66 events vs. 105 events ) , new STEMI ( 43 vs. 53 ) , and predominantly , myocardial infarction type 1 ( 63 vs. 128 ) ( Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix ) .
death from cardiovascular causes , new myocardial infarction , or ischemia @-@ driven revascularization ( the second coprimary composite outcome ) occurred in 179 patients ( 8.9 % ) in the complete @-@ revascularization group as compared with 339 patients ( 16.7 % ) in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group ( hazard ratio , 0.51 ; 95 % CI , 0.43 to 0.61 ; P < 0.001 ) ( Table 3 and Figure 1B ) .
the results of competing @-@ risk analyses with respect to the two coprimary outcomes were consistent with the results of the primary analyses ( Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix ) .
death from cardiovascular causes , new myocardial infarction , ischemia @-@ driven revascularization , unstable angina , or New York Heart Association class IV heart failure ( the key secondary outcome ) occurred in 272 patients ( 13.5 % ) in the complete @-@ revascularization group as compared with 426 patients ( 21.0 % ) in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group ( hazard ratio , 0.62 ; 95 % CI , 0.53 to 0.72 ) .
results for other secondary outcomes are shown in Table 3 .
subgroup ANALYSES AND TIMING OF NONCULPRIT @-@ LESION PCI
for the coprimary outcomes , there was no differential treatment effect in prespecified subgroups ( Figure 2 ) .
the benefit of complete revascularization was consistently observed among patients for whom the intended timing of nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI was during the index hospitalization and those for whom the intended timing was after hospital discharge ( P = 0.62 and P = 0.27 for interaction for the first and second coprimary outcomes , respectively ) .
in 87.1 % of the patients in the complete @-@ revascularization group , the actual timing of nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI corresponded to the intended timing specified by the investigator before randomization .
the hazard ratio for the first coprimary outcome with a complete @-@ revascularization strategy as compared with a culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI strategy was 0.77 ( 95 % CI , 0.59 to 1.00 ) in the subgroup for which in @-@ hospital nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI was intended and 0.69 ( 95 % CI , 0.49 to 0.97 ) in the subgroup for which postdischarge nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI was intended .
safety AND OTHER OUTCOMES
there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in the risk of major bleeding , stroke , or stent thrombosis ( Table 3 ) .
results for specific types of stent thrombosis are shown in Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix .
contrast @-@ associated acute kidney injury occurred in 30 patients in the complete @-@ revascularization group as compared with 19 patients in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group ( odds ratio , 1.59 ; 95 % CI , 0.89 to 2.84 ; P = 0.11 ) .
this event was attributed to the nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI procedure in 7 patients in the complete @-@ revascularization group as compared with none ( in accordance with the protocol ) in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group .
for those 7 patients , the intended timing of nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI was during the index hospitalization .
the COMPLETE trial showed that , among patients with STEMI and multivessel coronary artery disease , a strategy of staged nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI with the goal of complete revascularization resulted in a 26 % lower risk of a composite of death from cardiovascular causes or new myocardial infarction at a median follow @-@ up of 3 years than did a strategy of culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI .
this benefit was driven by the 32 % lower risk of new , nonfatal myocardial infarction in the complete @-@ revascularization group than in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group ; the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes was similar in the two groups .
for the second coprimary outcome , which included ischemia @-@ driven revascularization in addition to the other two events , the risk with a complete @-@ revascularization strategy was approximately half the risk with a culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI strategy .
there was no significant difference between the two groups in the risk of major bleeding or stroke .
the benefit of complete revascularization was consistently observed regardless of whether nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI was to be performed during the index hospitalization or several weeks after discharge from the hospital .
we designed the trial to have sufficient power to determine whether a complete @-@ revascularization strategy would lead to a meaningful reduction in the risk of the clinically important outcome of cardiovascular death or new myocardial infarction .
previous trials that evaluated a complete @-@ revascularization strategy in patients with STEMI were smaller and included revascularization as part of the composite primary outcome.14 @-@ 17
in the absence of a reduction in irreversible events such as cardiovascular death or new myocardial infarction , the clinical relevance of performing early nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI in all patients with multivessel coronary artery disease to prevent later PCI in a smaller number of those patients is debatable .
we have now found that routine nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI with the goal of complete revascularization confers a reduction in the long @-@ term risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction .
over a period of 3 years , the number needed to treat to prevent cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction from occurring in 1 patient is 37 patients , and the number needed to treat to prevent cardiovascular death , myocardial infarction , or ischemia @-@ driven revascularization from occurring in 1 patient is 13 patients .
at least 70 % stenosis in coronary arteries on visual estimation is routinely reported to be a standard criterion used in coronary angiography to establish the presence of angiographically significant coronary artery disease .
evidence of ischemia in the form of an FFR measurement of 0.80 or less was required only in patients with moderate stenosis ( 50 to 69 % ) , and only a small number of such patients were enrolled in the trial .
although it is possible that an FFR @-@ based approach to guide nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI could have reduced the number of PCI procedures among the patients included in the complete @-@ revascularization group , it is unclear how this strategy might have influenced the effect on hard clinical outcomes .
it is possible that angiographically significant lesions associated with an FFR measurement of more than 0.80 may still contain morphologic features consistent with unstable plaques , which confer an increased risk of recurrent events .
at least two trials involving patients with STEMI and multivessel coronary artery disease that evaluated an FFR @-@ based approach to guide nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI did not show a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction , although neither trial was powered for this outcome.16,17
in the COMPLETE trial , randomization was stratified according to the intended timing of nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI .
investigators had to specify before randomization whether they intended to perform nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI during the index hospitalization or after hospital discharge ( within 45 days ) if the patient were to be assigned to the complete @-@ revascularization group .
we found a consistent benefit of complete revascularization regardless of whether nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI was performed earlier , during the index hospitalization , or later , several weeks after discharge .
during the early period after STEMI , events related to the index infarction and culprit @-@ lesion PCI probably accounted for a substantial proportion of the events that occurred in both treatment groups .
the benefit of complete revascularization seems to have emerged over the long term , with continued divergence of the Kaplan @-@ Meier curves for several years .
limitations of our trial should be considered .
we did not evaluate nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI that was performed during the same procedure as that for the index culprit @-@ lesion PCI for STEMI .
although cardiogenic shock was not an exclusion criterion , no patients with cardiogenic shock were enrolled in the trial and the results should not be extrapolated to such patients .
complete revascularization was attained in more than 90 % of the patients in the complete @-@ revascularization group , and crossover to the nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI strategy occurred in only 4.7 % of the patients in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group .
it is unclear whether the trial results would have been similar if complete revascularization had been observed in fewer patients or if the crossover criteria in the culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI group had been more liberal .
in conclusion , the COMPLETE trial showed that , among patients with STEMI and multivessel coronary artery disease , a strategy of routine nonculprit @-@ lesion PCI with the goal of complete revascularization , performed either during the index hospitalization or soon after discharge , was superior to a strategy of culprit @-@ lesion @-@ only PCI in reducing the risk of death from cardiovascular causes or new myocardial infarction , as well as the risk of death from cardiovascular causes , new myocardial infarction , or ischemia @-@ driven revascularization , at a median follow @-@ up of 3 years .
